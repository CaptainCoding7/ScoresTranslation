{{1:}} {{REPENSER}} {{LES}} {{PRIORITÉS}} {{PRIORITÉS}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{ÉTRANGÈRE}} {{La}} and foreign policy is not {{elle}}
It requires continued political will and mobilisation of national resources to deal with international challenges.
Even the most powerful nations must deal with the {{cela}} forces, even more for Canada.
{{des}} the internal forces also affect foreign policy.
The effective mobilisation of national resources of a country depends on its human and physical characteristics, but also of this will that comes from the balanced combination of national objectives and international responsibilities.
In the case of Canada, the potential is there, as is the desire for {{de}} to see their country play an important role in the world.
We hope that this report will help to achieve this {{désir.}}
Any examination of foreign policy must take account of the international and internal changes that have been made.
The review of the {{fut}} was carried out in the Cold War, at a time when a light of {{et}} and the issues of unity and independence {{les}} the {{Canadiens.}}
At the last review in {{les}} the {{dominants}} issues were security and international competition, independence and {{l'internationalisme.}}
Only ten years later, the situation is still different at all.
We are living in a new era of {{comme}} changes such as witnesses to us in the {{audiences.}}
The end of the Cold War is certainly the most profound of these changes, but other {{transforment}} forces turn the nature of security, {{les}} economies and societies and make the concept of national sovereignty.
The global context in developing the Cold War has {{les}} the security cards not only in Europe but throughout the world.
In Europe, we are still waiting for the introduction of the new order which will replace the one from the {{Yalta.}} Conference.
The end of the Cold War has led to the freedom and the possibility of creating better societies, but it has also left a legacy of instability and {{division.}}
{{quant}} about the democratisation of Eastern Europe and Russia, as Professor Jacques {{de}} of the University of {{à}} in Montreal has told us.
{{Instabilité}} {{due}} due to {{après}} after the total {{total}} of the Communist period, old nationalist {{nationalistes}} and ethnic tensions in the former Soviet Union.
There is a division not only in the countries of the East, after the disintegration of the Communist regime, but also in the West where the end of the ideological fight between East and West has {{comme}} as Professor {{Stairs}} {{de}} of the University of {{(18:21),}} {{le}} the need for transatlantic solidarity.
In Asia, the end of the Cold War has also had {{inattendues.}} consequences.
It has put an end to the fight against {{et}} and the {{sino-soviétique.}} {{sino-soviétique.}} except from North Korea, it also encouraged greater openness to the West.
However, {{conflits}} conflicts {{la}} the proliferation of weapons, the risks of civil {{civils,}} and the prospect of {{durable»}} development is likely to complicate the search for a new regional balance, as Professor Brian {{de}} said in the University of {{Colombie-Britannique.}}
In the rest of the world, the old reference points have {{:}}
{{ne}} relations no longer determine {{et}} relations, and for some countries, international aid has lost its geopolitical dimension.
The north and the South are also in terms of {{la}} the very concept of the Third World is becoming {{puisque}} since the southern {{Sud}} has more and more diversity, and that the gap between rich and poor is as much as between North and South.
The new world does not provide for {{il}} it also presents opportunities to {{saisir.}}
The relatively stable confrontation between the East and the West has {{d'après}} according to Professor {{Middlemiss}} {{de}} of {{Dalhousie}} University {{à}} to a {{où}} where threats are very {{et}} and for which it is difficult to establish plans.
If we are in the past, which was {{nos}} our future opponents are {{ou}} or difficult to {{distinguer.}}
The problem is no longer to defend the West against the East, but to protect the community against the failure to comply with international order by those who still have the illegal use of force to impose their will.
That is the challenge facing us.
The military force is still too often a final {{ultime,}} but other factors such as political stability, economic force, sustainable development and social cohesion are becoming increasingly {{l'équation}}
On the other hand, terrorism, arms trafficking and drugs, mass migration and epidemics such as AIDS, are so many {{pour}} threats to security.
The fight for resources, environmental degradation and the decline in living levels are the causes of instability and {{comme}} conflicts such as more than one {{l'a}}
The old world order {{a}} has put forward a much more complex structure.
In military terms, the United States remains the dominant power throughout the world, but they no longer have the financial resources, nor the political will to continue to ensure leadership.
On the political and economic plans, the world is now around the United States, the European Union {{et}} and the {{tout}} while continuing to need each other to ensure their security, this {{se}} is a {{féroce.}} economic {{économique}}
China will soon be able to add this and we must also take account of Russia.
{{a}} technology has {{les}} transport, communications and data treatment thus contributing to {{le}} time and space, to remove national borders and to trigger profound economic and social changes.
Globalisation has led to a growing interdependence of countries and peoples.
The effects of economic and demographic growth on the global environment are clear.
The increase in trade has also led to the liberalisation of trade and, in some cases, regional integration.
The non-governmental entities have become important players in the international arena.
In fact, the main {{sont}} of globalisation are transnational societies which are the main sources of foreign investment in direct foreign investment.
According to the World Report for {{de}} investment in 1994, published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development {{«Une}} {{part}} a significant part of world production is being {{sous}} under the common {{commune}} of {{STN...}}
The nature of the global economy {{dans}} in this context, a fundamental change - a set of independent national economies whose markets are the main {{l'économie}} the global economy {{pour}} for the first time, a system of production production.
The liberalisation of trade and investment, combined with greater mobility of the factors of production factors, promotes no doubt that it is {{l'efficacité,}}
But the movement of labour-intensive production to labour-intensive production also means that growth does not lead to a corresponding increase in jobs.
Some developing countries, which are in favour of private investment, and which will increase investors and make cheap investment and cheap labour show a sustained increase in economic activity.
However, in many industrialised countries, structural adaptation is not {{mal.}}
On the other hand, globalisation ends up the division between foreign and political policy, which is increasingly subject to international competition forces.
The mobility of capital has pressure to ensure that governments {{les}} national policies.
The continuation of the highest comparative advantage puts pressure on governments to reduce social programmes and environmental protection programmes, {{font}} {{grimper}} the production costs of goods and {{et}} and reduce company tax.
These factors have no effect on the nature of sovereignty and the functioning of the state.
The national governments have less {{qu'avant,}} because of two types of pressure.
Firstly, an increased interdependence at global level has the Member States to share their sovereignty to resolve problems which the solution requires the adoption of international rules, which have the effect of imposing constraints on internal policy.
In this respect, it is possible to question the democratic legitimacy of the international institutions responsible for this process.
Secondly, in response to the effects of globalisation, people want to belong to a community and better control their own business, so that national governments are being {{de}} more and more powers to {{infra-nationales.}} {{infra-nationales.}}
As a result, the resources available to national governments are going to be {{tant}} both transnational and {{infranational.}}
We also see that the nature of sovereignty has changed with the proliferation of new states following the {{dont}} whose recent {{récente}} of the Soviet Union.
The number of sovereign states has more than {{depuis}} since 1945 and this increase makes it considerably more difficult for international problems.
Many of these new states lack economic infrastructure, social cohesion and political stability.
Most of them have {{de}} borders in the colonial era that have nothing logical and are net consumers and not net security suppliers.
It is still that, as we have seen, national borders are becoming increasingly {{et}} and national sovereignty is increasingly {{nuancé.}}
People now demand democratic institutions, a good government and respect for the rights of the individual.
The international community tends to consider these demands as legitimate interest or even as an international intervention.
All these trends are certainly not on Canada.
The end of the Cold War has {{la}} nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and with its risk that Canada is a victim of the effects of a nuclear conflict between the two powers.
It opened the way for new opportunities - cooperation between the old {{interventions}} constructive interventions of the UN, and a peaceful settlement of certain regional conflicts {{de}} peace in the Middle East, agreements in Central America and Cambodia, {{de}} {{Namibie).}}
Unfortunately, wars and ethnic conflicts which continue not only have caused enormous suffering, but also {{le}} trade and business, reduced the achievements of development aid and have led to considerable needs in emergency aid.
At the same time, the end of the order of {{offre}} perhaps offers more room for diplomatic manoeuvre for small and medium-sized powers as the former ambassador of Canada said in the United States.
{{en}} because of the new international {{internationale,}} we have greater scope for {{ce}} which opens up all kinds of new {{perspectives.»}}
In other words, if we know what kind of world we want and if we are prepared to work, there are opportunities to be {{saisir.}}
There is no more distinction between the internal and political policy of our days, since each has an impact on the other.
Foreign policy must be based on strong internal {{intérieures.}} at the same time, these domestic {{domestiques}} depend on the {{à}} of the key elements of national life, also education and culture.
In this sense, foreign policy is internal policy.
It has repercussions on the daily lives of the {{--}} - a standard of life, employment, environment, the management of resources, and the allocation of young people {{aux}} to the {{de}} of peace.
In this respect, the internal policy is foreign policy.
Solidarity is an essential condition if the {{veulent}} want to set up their economy and have a coherent and effective foreign policy.
Furthermore, the feeling that {{ont}} have their own value depends on the role that their country plays on the international stage.
Canada in developing our {{ont}} has enabled us to see how much Canada has changed with time, which is happening in Canada also influenced the way in which the {{réagissent}} respond to events abroad.
The impact of recent international events raises new questions on the values and interests of the {{et}} and on how to protect them and to promote them.
The immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America have {{enrichir}} the ethnic diversity of Canada.
The proportion of European origin {{d'origine}} in the population is no longer as much {{et}} and the Chinese is now the most {{au}} language in Canada after English and French.
At the same time, the centre of interest of the {{a}} has been a certain part of the Atlantic in the Pacific.
The family links of these {{et}} and their knowledge of other languages, cultures and use could be extremely useful for the foreign relations of Canada.
Many of these immigrants have experienced poverty, pollution and {{et}} and they are taking great account that Canada is a privileged society that deserves to be preserved.
Among the changes in Canada, the democratisation of foreign policy.
In addition to the {{provinciales}} {{et}} and {{de}} authorities of new players such as private associations, university and professional institutions and NGOs are making a greater contribution to the development of policy and the implementation of programmes.
Foreign affairs is less and less the {{du}} of the Federal Government and more and more the result of {{«d'Équipe-Canada».}} work.
In addition, the media have a great influence on the importance of these issues.
The human aspect of foreign policy, whether it is the rights of the individual, the status of women, the special needs of the {{de}} minorities of the importance of {{et}} and the development or the demands for social justice and equal opportunities is taking place in the {{grandissante.}}
The {{a}} economy has had difficulty in adapting to increasingly strong competition, but it has withdrawn a number of {{d'avantages.}}
The liberalisation of trade has had a beneficial effect on exports and on certain sectors of the economy, particularly high-tech industries, services and {{spécialisées.}} companies.
The raw materials sector have been very affected by the global decline in prices and competition that they are making other sources of supply.
Some {{ont}} industries have suffered both free trade and global restructuring and have been able to combat foreign competitors offering lower prices.
These problems have not been {{par}} by internal trade barriers which significantly weaken our competitive position on the international market, despite the recent {{visant}} agreement to reduce them.
The increase in growth rates caused by exports is perhaps a result of the decline in recession, but the country is still {{d'un}} a high level of unemployment and a huge public debt.
In the new global economy based on knowledge, Canada has difficulty in keeping its place among the main powers.
Canada has been {{par}} by its competitors in research and development, productivity, innovation and innovation and efforts to improve human resources are {{à}}
The tax rates and the distribution of investment have not improved things.
{{n'ont}} entrepreneurs have shown the necessary {{nécessaire}} to win the new foreign markets.
Canada is certainly a {{mais}} nation but it cannot be said that it is a nation of {{commerçants.}}
The protection of the environment and the conservation of long-term resources often come into conflict, in the short term, with employment and commercial {{commerciaux.}}
However, the rapid reduction in certain fish stocks and other fragile renewable resources has forced governments to take decisions to take decisions.
Furthermore, the {{--}} - both in the country and abroad - have strong pressure on these same governments and thus limit their freedom of action.
On the other hand, new opportunities for environmental industries and Canada have been one of the first to promote international environmental protection programmes.
Unfortunately, his reputation was {{par}} by the negative and sometimes no basis of which he has been subject to the way it protects its own environment.
From a cultural point of view, Canada has experienced unprecedented {{sans}}
It has seen two elements which are contradictory.
On the one hand, it has been more than ever {{par}} by culture and information on the other.
On the other hand, it has produced his own {{(émanant}} {{des}} {{anglophones,}} {{et}} the indigenous and other communities of {{en}} in quantity and as a {{précédent.}}
In fact, there is perhaps a link between the two, the globalisation of markets has {{la}} national creativity and its ideas in history, geography and the social fabric of the country.
It is now more than ever necessary and possible to make a {{à}} abroad abroad all the {{des}}
Canada is currently experiencing a period of national {{nationale}} which makes it even more difficult to adapt to changes that occur within and outside its borders.
In fact, its inability to resolve the constitutional issue has been disappointed by the {{et}} and has made foreigners {{perplexes.}}
The {{du}} of the debate around a possible division of the country sends a message of {{fragmentation.}}
The internal divisions are damaging to the full use of the various human resources of Canada.
In addition, there is {{entre}} tension between the advantages of interdependence with the United States and the need for a policy that is own in Canada and reflects its identity.
The {{doivent}} must have a clear vision of the role of their country in the world, and to resolve their internal problems so as to mobilise them in a constructive manner on the international stage if they want to live up to today's challenges and tomorrow.
Finally, they must, of course, draw up the reality of {{canadienne,}}
But they must increasingly be measured by the report, not to national standards, but to international standards.
The values and interests of the {{Malgré}} despite the rapid changes in Canada, some of the characteristics, which are own and which affect its international role, are {{les}}
From a {{:}} point of view, Canada must translate the reality of the two official languages, the many cultures, and a legal system.
{{d'un}} from a political point of view, the conduct of foreign policy is clearly the mark of the federal system when some areas of jurisdiction or shared jurisdiction are increasingly subject to international negotiations.
{{d'un}} from an economic point of view, the prosperity of the country depends on international trade, especially trade with the United States.
{{d'un}} from a {{le}} point of view, Canada must take account of its {{(pays}} Nordic geography to the {{clairsemée}} population on a large territory with the longest {{du}} {{du}} and also its {{avec}} relationship with the United States - its main partner, and its closest friend and {{allié.}}
{{canadienne}} society has remained very faithful to its {{:}} tolerance, dialogue and the search for {{l'attachement}} commitment to democracy, human rights and social and economic justice, the will to resolve global environmental problems and to fight peace and poverty in developing countries.
Canada is in many ways a {{de}} of the international society of tomorrow, a place where people are {{diverses}} different {{cohabiter}} and share the fruits of their {{labeur.}}
{{ont}} have transposed these values to foreign policy.
As we have pointed out on several occasions, the {{veulent}} want a foreign policy based on these values.
They must guide us and help to establish coherent policies.
These must be {{idéalistes}} {{dans}} in their design but realistic in their application.
The contribution of {{à}} to foreign affairs is linked to their values.
They have been excellent {{capables}} capable of helping opponents to find a {{d'entente.}}
They have a particular knowledge of the problems posed by a society characterised by diversity.
They have actively fought for pollution, promoted the conservation and {{la}} of the {{démunis.}}
Moreover, in the area of the maintenance of peace, they have acquired more experience than others.
As we can see, the values and competences are not {{pas,}} but the question is whether the necessary resources can be {{dans}} in the interests of the country.
On the one hand, the government has much more financial resources than in the past, and this situation is not almost {{s'améliorer.}}
Therefore, establishing the priorities and finding ways to draw the best of our resources will be one of the main challenges facing us in the coming years.
On the other hand, as has been pointed out by the {{du}} of the National Forum if the financial resources of governments were {{les}} the resources of the {{elles,}} society have developed and {{au}} over the years.
In this respect, I would like to mention the words of Pierre {{:}} on the whole, the members of the {{étaient}} were in the opinion that the government should play a role in mobilising and coordinating resources within the {{canadienne.}} society.
It already has extraordinary resources.
The government is no longer the {{mais}} but it is not the case with the {{canadienne.}} society.
At the same time, the committee recognises the {{Janice}} {{coprésidente}} {{coprésidente}} {{Forum}} of the National Forum, which {{gouvernement}} of Canada cannot be everywhere and {{faire...}} if it is trying to do so, it will not succeed in drawing up policies which give an advantage to {{comparatif.»}}
As we have repeatedly pointed out, the {{devront}} will have to decide how to distribute the resources available to serve the interests of Canada.
Once these decisions have been taken, it will be essential to count on a strong external service, properly equipped with the {{des}} requirements of international affairs.
While the area of foreign policy {{s'est}} has developed substantially to deal with new international requirements, expenditure for operations abroad has decreased by 25 % in the last decade.
There is a limit to {{plus}}
We therefore believe that the resources for the instruments of foreign policy, and in particular the external service, are responsible and proportionate to the objectives of the foreign policy which will {{de}} this report.
The main task of this review of foreign policy is to reassess the interests of Canada in the light of the rapid development of the international context, to make the point of the national resources available and to adapt to the foreign policy of Canada and to promote the opportunities that exist in order not only for the interests of the {{mais}} but to promote a more peaceful and prosperous world.
A new agenda for foreign policy none of the witnesses of the Committee has recommended that Canada withdraw from the world.
On the contrary, most of them were firmly convinced that the {{devraient}} should adopt a more {{et}} approach and a more {{et}} approach and that the welfare of Canada and {{est}} is linked to the rest of the world.
{{Plewes,}} {{directrice}} administrative {{administrative}} of the Canadian Council for International Cooperation has expressed this reality very well when it noted that national {{national}} has a broad dimension of {{mondiale...}}
We believe it is time to become international citizens {{coopératifs.»}}
In the next chapters we will detail in detail the Canadian interests that are at stake, as well as possible options on a bilateral and bilateral level, and we will make recommendations on future policies of Canada.
Common security, common prosperity and the common protection of the environment, which are the most important global challenges in the 1990s and {{constituent}} are the main themes of the {{la}} report, the proposal by the Canadian Institute of International Affairs {{de}} of the capital capital.
In order to be able to meet these challenges, Canada must have confidence in its {{à}} identity and to make a strong contribution to the radiation abroad through its cultures and resources.
It is essential for Canada, for the survival of the planet and for the well-being of its inhabitants that each of these challenges is {{relevé.}}
The security of Canada depends on a stable international order strengthened by multilateral cooperation.
The prosperity of Canada depends on a modern economy that must be increasingly integrated into a competitive competitive economy.
Even with regard to natural resources, where it has a more favourable situation than most countries, Canada depends on international cooperation to protect the environment.
In the long term, we all have a common security and common prosperity and a healthy environment, or no one {{jouira.}}
We therefore need international conduct standards and political and economic systems based on rules that prevent arbitrary or unilateral action from a state which could damage the legitimate interests of others.
Canada has every interest in promoting the creation of a collective security system, under the auspices of the United Nations, to protect the law and public order at international level.
The importance of trade for Canada requires vigorous action to build relations on trade, investment and technology, and strategic economic alliances and these measures must be combined with greater liberalisation of trade on the basis of an effective system of international rules.
It is also important for Canada to contribute to the relief of poverty and the sustainable development of the developing countries, not only because this is a moral imperative for citizens in the responsible world but also because such action will promote political stability, the application of the principles of good government and respect for the rights of the individual.
Canada has similar reasons for doing what it can for the enlargement of international law, the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the greatest respect for the rights of the individual in {{pas}} however, that we must be {{par}} by example.
Canada has very particular interests because it is half of the northern continent of the continent of Africa.
On the one hand, it must manage the very important relations with the United States in a partnership based on mutual respect.
On the other hand, it must seek a greater role on the world stage beyond North America.
Canada is also deeply affected by the way it manages and protects its fish stocks, forests and other vulnerable resources.
Finally, Canada is increasingly interested in dealing with and reconciling the needs of the {{de}} environment and development in the Arctic.
The inhabitants of this {{monde»}} {{(et}} (and the countries that {{sont}} are less and less able to determine their quality of life.
It is increasingly dependent on the way in which we are {{la}} international society and managing global heritage.
However, this kind of international commitment cannot be achieved itself.
There must be a {{coordonnée}} organised {{articulée,}} vision and supported by intellectual and financial resources.
This is the challenge that Canada and the {{ont}} face today, but it is also an opportunity not to be {{manquer.}}
{{2:}} 2 {{LA}} {{SÉCURITÉ}} {{SÉCURITÉ}} {{COMMUNE}}
Our security depends on more and more {{qui}} factors which can be given as much to the internal stability of the Member States than international stability.
It is then more difficult for the international community to react in good time and effectively to threats against security.
In addition, the development of security policies is complicated.
Although military {{la}} the world situation seems less directly {{le}} Canada is called upon to contribute more to international security at a time when budgetary restrictions are {{sa}} its ability to act.
Although this chapter deals with the impact of the international situation on the safety of Canada, we must not forget that other problems, linked to sovereignty and security, affect us more closely in the Arctic.
In this respect, a report on safety in a developing world on defence policy has just been tabled before Parliament.
The {{du}} of the concept of security as has been pointed out by several {{l'accent}} the emphasis in the Cold War on military power and the risk of a huge war has led to an enlargement of the concept of security.
According to Pierre {{coprésident}} the {{du}} of the National Forum on International Relations of Canada, {{a}} foreign policy is the first priority of the {{humaine»,}} {{c'est-à-dire}} that is, human rights, economic prosperity and environmentally friendly development.
{{Sahnoun}} {{a}} said: {{ingrédients}} of crises, which are of course - that they are ethnic or religious or social - will come together as {{avant}} before the storm is such that there can be no different circumstances.
It is clear that these circumstances are very closely linked to economic and {{ressources.»}} issues.
{{Pearson}} {{a}} said that internal conflicts would increase for two reasons: the disparity between rich and poor and demographic pressure on resources.
According to {{Blakeney,}} {{c'est}} it is the escalation of small conflicts which are threatening the greatest world peace.
We have found these very useful comments as demonstrated in this report.
It is clear that the global problems, which is growing quickly, such as demographic growth, poverty, pollution and the proliferation of weapons, are growing threats to Canada.
And these problems are linked to each other.
{{peut}} growth can lead to increased demand for resources, a growing disparity between the rich and the poor risk of {{excessive.}}
As for the {{de}} degradation of the environment, it can exacerbate the situation.
It may result in a reduction in agricultural production, economic decline and the movement of population and social problems.
The despair of the result offers fertile ground to violence.
These situations often {{souvent}} with the lack of democratic standards, with the violation of the rights of the person and minorities, two factors which also promote violence.
{{dans}} in one or other of these areas can lead to the use of violence or the threat of using it or to war.
Conversely, armed conflicts can have repercussions on one or a number of these areas.
The policies on the environment, trade and development aid are directly linked to our security.
However, they are sufficiently different to justify special treatment for each of them.
We therefore believe that it would be wise for us to make a clear distinction in the area of security, a clear distinction between traditional concerns, which relate to the use of force or the threat of {{et}} and the new concerns, which could damage the interests of the other or cause {{pouvant}} which could lead to the interests of the other or cause {{pouvant}}
The instrument of policy adapted to such a situation would be used in the most effective way that we will continue to keep this distinction.
For a country which, like Canada, cannot set the agenda for the international agenda, but which must establish its own priorities, we do not believe it is useful to draw up policy in a {{irréaliste.}} {{force}}
As Mr {{de}} said, the University of {{«il}} {{faut}} has to be very careful in the {{de}} of certain {{surtout}} especially that Canada is not a great {{puissance.»}}
Nor would it be useful for collective security to be {{sur}} cooperative security and common security.
The task is collective as all the Member States have to agree to use the strength or threaten to use it and help those who are {{attaqués.}}
The methods must be {{dans}} as Member States must seek multilateral methods to work with each other rather than against each other.
And the results need to be implemented because security is a dimension of global heritage.
In our opinion, this enlargement of the concept of security has several {{dont}} which is better than cure.
{{est}} is that the more a preventive measure, more it is difficult to mobilise the political will to act.
The crisis in the former Yugoslavia has been very clear.
And it is often difficult to know what kind of action would be most effective.
In the case of Rwanda, for example, international assistance has not been enough to prevent the {{du}} of ethnic conflict, and to ask whether the international community could have prevented the civil war by military intervention at the right time.
A second {{c'est}} is that foreign policy and defence policy must strengthen each other.
Foreign policy must be supported by a credible defence policy, and defence policy must be in the interests of clearly defined foreign policy.
The strategy must aim to match military commitments to political commitments.
Although prevention problems are always difficult, it can be better to solve them by more closely coordinating foreign policy and defence policy.
Another consequence is that foreign and internal policy are two sides of the same coin.
Indeed, they are closely linked and therefore internal policy is also exposed to the growing impact of foreign policy on the growing factors affecting Canada and its citizens.
That is why it is essential to coordinate the two elements so that the various aspects of each of them are compatible.
Perhaps it would be necessary to {{au}} within the government, a mechanism for the overall coordination of the various components of security.
The Committee is convinced of the need to adopt a broader concept of security, including both military and military factors.
In addition, the committee recommends that this concept be reflected in both the establishment of a high-level mechanism within the government - the {{Cabinet,}} Committee by {{et}} and the restructuring of appropriate parliamentary committees in order to ensure the integrated treatment of the various security elements.
The sections following various aspects of safety which are calling into question the use of violence or the threat of {{recourir.}}
The other factors are addressed in other chapters.
The United Nations the end of the Cold War released the UN Security Council of the confrontation between {{a}} increased the expectations of the public and offered the UN new opportunities for peace and international security.
On the other hand, it asked him to have unprecedented challenges and a wave of humanitarian and peace for which it is {{équipée.}}
The UN is now {{surchargée}} {{et}} and {{et}} and it has been {{que}} only {{hésitante}} to the task of establishing a collective security regime adapted to the Cold War.
The most urgent issues are {{:}} {{peut-on}} can be done to revitalise the UN and improve its performance and {{et}} and {{pourrait}} could be the contribution of Canada to this {{égard?»}}
Of course, the UN is in the position that it cannot do anything without the consent of its Member States.
As they have said, the {{veulent}} want the UN to {{une}} a real force for an international system based on the rule of law.
On the other hand, they believe that it is necessary to reform the fundamental reform so that it will respect the respect it has lost.
In order for the UN to achieve its potential, we will have to do more to give it the necessary structures, political orientation and resources that are currently lacking.
In terms of structures, it is important to reform the Security Council so that it has confidence in all Member States.
We are currently looking at the possibility of extending the Council and change working methods.
It is very close to everyone who is {{sur}} on the need to extend the Council to strengthen the legitimacy of its decisions.
The Canadian Committee on the 50th anniversary of the United Nations has issued a series of serious proposals in the {{intitulé}} {{Un}} a action plan for the {{l'ONU.}}
However, there are several questions.
How many members should be {{aux}} to the fifteen {{actuels?}}
It is probably impossible to add less than four if we want to take account of developing countries, and it would be better not to add more than six if the Council is to become too {{lourd.}}
How many permanent members should be {{ajouter?}}
Japan and Germany are the main candidates, but the South {{latine,}} Latin America, Asia and {{a}} also has the right to claim to three permanent {{permanents.}}
{{Les}} the new permanent members should have the right to {{veto?}}
In many respects, the veto is a {{puisqu'il}} because it is a {{de}} of national sovereignty, the concept which is constantly {{rétrécir.}}
Although it is not realistic to expect the current permanent members to {{il}} we believe that we should do nothing to extend and do anything to reduce it.
For issues of principle as well as practical reasons, it is necessary to make the Security Council deliberations more transparent.
The practice of the Council to work behind closed doors will undoubtedly make the consensus and allow the right of veto to be avoided.
However, we believe that, like {{Fréchette,}} {{récente}} recent {{du}} of Canada to the UN {{que}} that the Council must be more interested in the needs of the countries that are not part of the Council, but that the Council deliberations are interested in {{(par}} the countries which provide quotas to peacekeeping operations.
These countries have the right to be kept aware of what is happening and to have easy access to the Council when need be, and the Council has everything to gain in facilitating this communication in the right direction.
The Committee believes that measures are required without delay to extend the Security Council to make it more {{représentatif.}}
It also believes that the Council must adopt more transparent working methods to facilitate communication between the members of the Council and the countries that are not part of it, but who have interests to defend or concern particular concerns.
{{sont}} are rightly proud of the role of their country since the start in the UN peace operations.
{{Stein,}} {{coprésidente}} {{du}} of the National Forum has indicated that for almost all participants in the {{le}} the maintenance of peace was a priority and that the {{avaient}} had an advantage on other {{(2:10).}}
However, the number and nature of these operations have been very {{énormément}} since the first {{de}} of peace have taken place in {{en}}
The term {{de}} of {{sert}} is now being used to appoint a wide range of {{préventive,}} peace operations and the restoration of peace, peace and consolidation of {{paix).}}
At present, around 70 000 {{de}} military soldiers are participating in 18 peace operations, compared with 12 000 at the beginning of 1992.
The {{pays}} country of {{le}} Canada is moving between 2 500 and 3 000 soldiers or around 3.5 {{100}} 100 % of the UN budget, which is largely in line with the UN budget.
In view of the scale and the growing complexity of peace operations, it is particularly important to us, in our opinion, that they receive the most clear political {{politique}}
By publishing the agenda for peace, the Secretary-General made a step in this direction, but we must do more.
The UN operations are still suffering from two major problems which are linked to one other - a problem of doctrine {{quelles}} what circumstances should the UN {{intervenir?}}
What is the duration of its {{intervention?}}
When should it be {{retirer?)}}
Can the UN be able to obtain qualified staff and the funds of the United Nations at the same time.
It is essential to resolve these problems if Canada is going to continue to risk the lives of its soldiers in the service of peace.
As we have heard in the UN seat it must question its presence in the Balkans, Cambodia and Somalia, where it is more and more to do what it has never done, in other words to intervene in cases that have been previously internal and to rebuild states and civil societies in {{déroute.}}
The financing of peace operations is currently the biggest budgetary problem, exacerbated by the {{des}} of American contributions and the chronic delay of Russian payments.
{{des}} of peacekeeping contributions {{3,2}} EUR {{milliards}} billion {{L'arriéré}}
And the current number of peace {{de}} may have reached the limit of what Member States are prepared to do.
The UN does not have the means to do everything everywhere, and it has still not been given a set of criteria to guide in its decisions.
We urgently believe that clear and consistent criteria for intervention and {{de}} should be established so that missions are not {{sans}} without the settlement of the conflict.
Otherwise, there is a danger that it is the media that determine the agenda - the {{CNN).}}
Experience shows that the success of peace efforts depends mainly on the speed of intervention in the conflict, which is essential, that planning is essential, that a quite clear idea of the political regulation of the conflict and that diplomatic efforts must be accompanied by a credible force and the will to use it.
We therefore believe that we should seek more to combine appropriate political, economic and military measures in an integrated set of {{de}} {{l'escalade»,}} which are the subject of preventing rather than {{guérir.}}
At all stages the military force would be available and economic sanctions would be planned for the support of political or diplomatic steps (for example, the maintenance of preventive peace in support of preventive diplomacy, the maintenance of peace in support of the restoration of diplomatic peace in support of the development of diplomatic peace.
The UN has no permanent forces that it can send out in the {{chauds.}}
It must therefore go back every time.
{{distingués}} senior UN officials like {{Brian}} Brian {{et}} and {{comme}} like {{Pearson}} {{soutiennent}} support a permanent force that can easily be deployed in the event of a crisis is the only long-term solution.
The agenda for peace is more {{de}} to create special voluntary forces for risk situations.
When he visited the United Nations, the committee heard various proposals to improve the UN capacity to react quickly to a crisis.
However, all the proposals must take into account the difficult problems of organisation and control that the UN Member States are unlikely to be able to change quickly.
In order to help resolve these problems, the Canadian Government has announced that it will be looking at the options available to strengthen the UN ability to respond quickly in the event of crisis.
One of the options to study would be the creation of a permanent UN military force.
The Committee is in favour of this study, because it hopes that its findings will help the UN to have a realistic and effective policy in the event of a crisis.
Another question is: should the UN try to manage all the peace operations directly in the world?
In the Agenda for peace, the Secretary-General advocates greater cooperation between the UN and regional bodies, in accordance with Article 52 of the UN Charter.
According to him, such cooperation will be the burden of the Security Council and could create a greater sense of participation, consensus and democratisation in the conduct of international affairs.
The UN has recently cooperated with regional groups on specific issues, with the Organisation of African Unity and the League of Arab states on the subject of {{Somalie,}}
with the Association of South-East Asia on the subject of Cambodia
With the Organisation of American States, on Nicaragua and {{Salvador,}}
With the European Union the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe {{et}} and NATO on the subject of former Yugoslavia.
We believe that this is a positive trend.
It is true that certain regions, in particular, are better than others to take this kind of responsibility.
The {{à}} at its {{en}} conference in 1992, declared a regional body in terms of the UN Charter and officially indicated that NATO was its peacekeeping and peace mechanism.
The future development of both NATO and {{est}} is being examined {{sous}} under heading {{euro-atlantique».}}
Other measures have already been proposed by Canada in order to reform the peace missions, including the {{Il}}
{{Améliorer}} the control and political direction of the Security Council and ensure better coordination between the Council, the Secretary-General and the countries of {{contingents.}}
More specifically, these countries should be involved in diplomatic negotiations and political decisions linked to military operations or, at least to be consulted.
{{Renforcer}} the rapid warning mechanisms of the {{en}} by giving it the information and expertise needed to identify the points that can become {{chauds.}}
It should also strengthen its ability to coordinate large-scale peace operations, while encouraging the UN seat to promote decentralisation of {{afin}} in order to give more responsibility to elements on the ground.
{{Améliorer}} to improve training and {{les}} the way in which the forces affected so that they can work together more effectively.
Canada is well placed to help train and provide {{provenant}} {{provenant}} from developing countries and to promote coordination and interoperability so that the UN peace missions are carried out more quickly and {{en}} in fact, the quality of intervention and the speed of implementation are often more important than the number of soldiers.
{{gén.}} {{commandant}} {{commandant}} {{de}} of the {{Valcartier,}} {{a}} recommended the establishment of a training centre in Canada to the members of the headquarters for UN {{de}}
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr {{a}} recently announced to the United Nations General Assembly, openness in {{d'un}} a research and training centre on the maintenance of peace.
We believe that the {{veulent}} want their country to continue to play its role as guardian of peace, but Canada can no longer afford to go around and respond every time to the United Nations {{des}}
As {{Middlemiss}} {{de}} of the University of {{(18:33)}} {{l'a}} said, Canada must not accept the {{«le}} of the {{entier».}} world.
At the moment, as {{Stairs}} {{le}} pointed out, {{demande}} is too strong - expectations are too high and our ability is too {{(18:36).}}
We will therefore have to be more {{et}} and establish flexible implementing criteria which will facilitate the task.
Some criteria already governing the participation of Canada to peace missions {{notamment}}
{{un}} a realistic and clear mandate with a level of risk {{acceptable;}}
{{la}} the cooperation of the parties in conflict and a process approved to find a long-term {{à}}
{{la}} the will of the Member States to provide a representative force corresponding to {{mandat;}}
{{un}} an effective {{efficace,}} {{onusien}} a clear {{claire}} line and financial and logistical support {{*}}
{{l'accord}} the agreement of all parties to {{canadienne.}}
These criteria can be extended to take account of the type of kind of contribution made by Canada, or the degree of interest for Canada.
For example, there are four categories of {{qui}} which will {{les}} decisions on the participation of the country to peace operations.
The degree of difficulty in the conflict of the conflict, the feasibility of the mandate, a degree of risk cooperation between parties, support or not.
{{envergure}} the operation of the operation of the operation of {{:}} the maintenance of {{ou}} or the operation of {{génération»}} {{engageant}} {{des}} {{des}} and civilians, or even {{de}} {{de}}
The possibilities for {{type}} type of contribution from Canada {{d'«avant-garde»}} {{ou}} or maintenance of traditional peace, military {{militaire,}} or intervention of a quota of military and {{durée}} {{prévue}} {{de}}
{{efficacité}} operational efficiency {{dispositions}} are the {{sont-elles}} of {{efficaces,}} {{efficaces,}} the {{de}} of the {{définis;}} {{bien}} financial and logistical support is {{l'effectif}} {{est-il}} is {{les}}
{{intérêts}} interests of Canada {{avec}} with the country or the {{belligérants;}}
NATO commitment or other organisations whose Canada is {{partie;}}
The level of threat to international order and global security, as in the former Yugoslavia and {{Cambodge;}}
The intensity of human suffering, as in Somalia and {{Rwanda;}}
The scale of the challenge of democracy, as well as {{l'opinion}} public opinion and the question of whether Canada will make a {{différence).}}
The aim of these criteria would not be to regulate defence policy, but to provide a list of elements that could be assessed in each case, so that a policy is based on the best combination of factors.
For example, decision-makers can be consistent and {{que}} that the tasks of success are high, which are in general the interests of the country and which offer Canada the opportunity to make a positive contribution.
On the other hand, we think it is not realistic to expect Canada to be able to decide to take part in {{«faible}} {{ou}} or to determine the level of risk.
The conflicts are classified according to a large {{intensité.}}
The majority of the security problems which Canada will face in the foreseeable future will probably be low at the average {{mais}} but a {{intensité}} conflict is also dangerous for a soldier that a more {{et}} conflict and requires very great training.
Canada will be able to choose when it is possible to participate in the operations that call for the greatest talent of the {{Canadiens}}
By {{une}} a high military competence, air transport and air traffic control, logistics and communications, medical teams and the monitoring of the police and mediation teams and mediation {{civile).}}
For example, it will be possible to combine elements of intervention with an improved quota involving civilians and military {{afin}} so that Canada can help the United Nations to intervene quickly and then put in place a {{taille}} force that can deal with the long-term civilians.
In this way, Canada will be involved in less missions, but its participation will be more important.
In any case, as Mr Watson said, a rational sharing of the tasks and strengthening cooperation between three major categories of participants in peace operations, namely that is to say, {{:}}
The seat of the United Nations and the forces on the {{les}} multilateral bodies such as the United Nations {{des}} for Refugees the World Food Programme and {{et}} and implementing bodies - NGOs and {{volontaire).}} {{volontaire).}}
These are some of the suggestions put forward in order to achieve such an objective - a {{détachements}} {{personnel,}} programme and a systematic exchange of information and the creation of a permanent tripartite body for the link or round table to follow the participation of Canada in emergency emergency operations.
The committee recommends the establishment of clear and uniform criteria for regulating UN interventions and closer integration of political, economic and military measures to every stage of UN peace mission.
It is also in favour of increasing the resources of the secretariat so that it can give rapid {{et}} and coordinate both the military contributions of the Member States and other participants in peace missions.
On the other hand, it would be good to look forward to decentralisation of peace operations at regional level, when it is feasible, so that if the Security Council decides that intervention is needed, it can allow a regional body to launch a precise operation under the auspices of the United Nations.
The Committee believes that the main role of Canadian {{canadiennes}} on the international stage should be to support the peacekeeping operations of peace, but it recommends that Canada is involved in a more selective way, after assessing its interests and determined the areas of {{tant}} both military and civilians, in which the {{excellent.}} {{excellent.}}
The training of the UN troops and staff peacekeeping staff should become one of the main elements of the {{canadienne.}} policy.
{{L'Europe}} Europe and the transatlantic partnership are characterised by uncertainty at this stage of transition between the {{de}} world and a new order, which remains to be defined.
It is no longer a matter of ensuring the collective defence of the West against the East, but to establish a collective security regime in order to protect peaceful states against the {{autorisée}} use of force to deal with disputes.
Although it is from the Cold War, NATO seems to be a key element of European security.
It is a {{à}} force in the continent and provides Germany with a multilateral framework to enable it to play its central role in Europe.
It helps to maintain the strategic balance in Europe and is a guarantee of security in the face of a Russia that {{des}} the ruins of the former Soviet Union, where 25 million Russians live in new independent states.
It is a bulwark against the {{de}} of defence and remains the main body of consultation.
We have been {{par}} by the major changes in NATO to respond to the new expectations of the Cold War.
NATO has {{sa}} its strategy in the context of a partnership between East and West, leaving the {{elle}} it has adopted new security functions which emphasise crisis management, and it has changed the structure of its forces accordingly.
The trend is to reduce {{à}} to a situation of less and to the division of forces in four {{:}}
The immediate action forces {{de}} the {{aéroportées}} detection of NATO, the {{allié}} ally in Europe {{la}} mobile {{mobile}} {{et}} and {{ainsi}} {{que}} and the permanent forces of the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the {{de}} of {{mines);}}
The rapid action forces of the rapid action of the {{avec}} with the air forces and the {{obtenues}} obtained from action forces have been {{des}}
The main defence forces (the {{navales}} {{et}} and air {{en}} in Europe and organised in {{multinationales);}} {{multinationales);}} and {{(forces}} {{d'appoint}} {{navales}} {{provenant}} from North America, Portugal and perhaps France and {{l'Espagne).}}
NATO has supported peacekeeping operations which took place under the auspices of the {{et}} and the UN in {{et}} and former Yugoslavia.
It also seeks to set up operational operational forces combined with special operations, which could appeal to the forces of the Member States.
{{la}} to the East, NATO has set up a security cooperation mechanism, the {{(CCNA),}} Cooperation Council {{composé}} composed of Member States of NATO, nations which were linked to the Warsaw Pact and states born from the {{de}} of {{l'URSS.}}
NATO also concluded partnership agreements for peace with most of these nations in order to achieve planning, training and exercises for peace missions.
Canada fully supports these measures.
Europeans who have emphasised the European Security and Defence {{européenne}} {{le}} the transatlantic link has changed.
At the summit in January 1991, the reports between the Union of Western Europe {{organe}} a military body of the European Union, and NATO were more clearly defined.
NATO agreed that the WEU was free to undertake autonomous operations, and the WEU has recognised that NATO will {{l'organisme}} the Director of {{euro-atlantique.}}
This means two things for Canada - Europe can take greater responsibility for its security but there is also the danger that, if Europe is to organise its security regardless of NATO, then it can encourage the withdrawal of Canada and the United States.
Therefore, it is increasingly important to retain its vitality in the transatlantic partnership.
The {{autre}} another product of the Cold War, has also suffered {{remaniements.}}
First of all, as a {{pour}} to promote the {{entre}} between East and West following the Helsinki Helsinki Act, the {{est}} is now with institutions and has been responsible for extended functions in three areas: the rights of the individual, democracy and the primacy of the {{la}} the prevention of conflicts and the management of the {{la}} security of conflict and the control of {{armements.}}
Having been members of Canada, the United States and 51 countries of Europe and Asia have been {{d'Asie}}
It is very well placed to encourage the adoption of standards for the exercise of democracy and for the treatment of minorities, with the help of {{aux}} to national minorities.
On the other hand, its {{rend}} composition makes it difficult to take decisions to apply these standards.
However, the Secretary-General of the {{Wilhelm}} {{Hoynck,}} {{a}} said to the Committee in his passage to Brussels that even if there was a need for consensus to send a mission in a {{régional,}} regional {{chaud}} the mission could work independently and {{suite.}}
In our opinion, NATO and {{comptent}} are all the two to their own {{précieux.}}
NATO is the only international institution with a {{de}} {{unifié,}} {{unifié,}} {{de}} and permanent forces ready to support preventive diplomacy activities and to maintain peace.
With its moral force, {{peut}} can act as a regional {{régional}} under the United Nations Charter, and to legitimise the use of military measures to implement the UN decisions on the safety of Europe.
Both entities are complementary but they need to be made more precise on the tasks to be done and to strengthen the operational links that unite them in the UN, so that each can play the role that is best to be done.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{dans}} in a strategic vacuum are grateful to NATO of its {{et}} influence and some would like to join in {{l'alliance.}}
They regard the {{et}} and {{comme}} as temporary solutions, but they realise that they are not yet prepared to respond to the conditions established to be a full member of NATO.
{{pour}} for its part, is prepared to accept new members in good time, but it is not prepared to offer guarantees for security, in addition to its {{de}} will to consult every active member of the peace partnership that feels a direct threat to its territorial integrity and its political independence or security.
We believe that there are good reasons for encouraging the training of partnerships with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and with those of the former Soviet Union, but we must not create a division in Europe in this {{moment-ci,}}
Because it would damage the efforts undertaken to bring Russia into the process of {{d'un}} a new collective security regime covering Europe.
As Jacques {{de}} said, of the University of {{à}} in Montreal - by creating the impression of a new health {{sanitaire}} around Russia, there is a risk of increasing nationalist feelings among the Russians already {{par}} by the double test of poverty and the loss of their {{empire.}}
Since the end of the Cold War, Canada has withdrawn its {{en}} troops in Europe and closed its two foundations in Germany.
At present, Canada maintains the following commitments towards the four categories of NATO forces.
{{Les}} the immediate action forces - a {{au}} in Canada to support the mobile force of the {{en}} {{Norvège;}} a crew on a NATO plane for the {{aéroportée;}} detection of {{destroyer}} or {{pour}} to participate in the permanent shipbuilding force of the Atlantic.
{{Les}} the rapid action forces - two {{de}} of {{F-18}} {{F-18}} based on {{une}} a {{de}} defence {{de}}
The main defence forces have no force in Europe, Canada does not participate in it.
{{Les}} the {{:}} forces, the additional {{supplémentaires}} forces {{destroyers}} {{frégates,}} and {{un}} a ship of {{trois}} three {{14}} {{aéronefs}} {{aéronefs}} {{aéronefs}} and 25 {{et}} and a {{stationné}} {{au}} in Canada.
Canada is also prepared for staff in the headquarters of NATO to finance infrastructure projects, in hand with NATO, and to make it available to its allies of training facilities in Canada, to reimbursement the costs.
We believe that the relatively modest cost of our accession to NATO is a good good one.
This gives us strategic information, {{avec}} with the {{et}} forces and access to the most important {{les}}
Canada should be ready to pay the necessary contribution to be able to attend and participate in the deliberations of the institutions that can have repercussions on its interests.
All those who have shown before the Committee in Brussels stressed the importance of Canada and the political and military role of Canada in {{la}} the high quality of its contribution to consultations and value of its experience in maintaining peace.
According to them, the exact nature of the military role played by Canada has been far less than its {{continue.}}
In general, the withdrawal of the Canadian forces in Europe was accepted in Europe, but the decision taken without prior consultation was {{critiquée.}}
If Canada is now going to {{maintenant}} in peace missions that are better with its national interests and priorities, NATO could probably {{accommoder.}}
The Committee considers that Canada should remain an active member of NATO.
It should also encourage this organisation to become a collective security body for the whole of Europe, in cooperation with the members of the peace partnership.
In the same way, Canada should encourage NATO and the UN to maintain closer links and should restructure the forces affected by NATO, in consultation with its allies, to better support the peacekeeping operations of NATO under the auspices of the United Nations or {{CSCE.}}
Canada should also encourage {{à}} to strengthen its institutions, in particular those who deal with prevention and conflict resolution and to extend their procedures to enable them to intervene more quickly.
Security in North America the relationship with the United States on defence is the most important thing of all that it has {{à}} at international level.
This relationship goes back on the eve of the Second World War, when President {{et}} and Prime Minister {{King}} {{énoncèrent,}} {{énoncèrent,}} {{des}} in {{le}} statements the fundamental principle that the United States would not {{aucune}} any {{menacer}} power to threaten Canada, and Canada would leave no one to cross its territory to attack the United States.
{{Hyde}} {{et}} and Declaration {{en}} in {{et}} and {{permirent}} {{d'élaborer}} to draw up cooperation mechanisms and defence production mechanisms.
When Canada and the United States were united in European countries to establish NATO in {{la}} cooperation in defence is {{en}} in principle, a regional {{régional,}} but in practice it has remained completely {{distincte.}}
The {{de}} of the air defence {{tard}} late {{de}} from North America and the United States in {{est}} has remained as well as {{distinct.}}
Canada does not participate in the unified space of the United States, created at the same time as the {{mais}} but the {{utilise}} is using the information of the {{pour}} to carry out its defence operations against {{et}} missiles and the security threats of the world which are perhaps {{non}} not only against North America but also against the rest of the world.
In the Cold War, the {{qui}} threat to North America has {{mais}} a great deal of {{mais}} but the {{remplit}} meets other functions, including general surveillance and the fight against drugs.
It also provides Canada with valuable strategic information which the country would not have any {{autrement.}}
The greatest uncertainty affects the defence of {{et}} {{et}} and the possibility of {{non}} not the {{que}} that the United States, which is now focusing their attention on the danger of {{accidentels}} {{ou}} or {{balistiques}} {{limités}} limited by {{dissidents,}} countries, want to integrate their warning and defence systems against {{balistiques.}} {{balistiques.}}
Such a measure will {{pour}} for Canada serious questions about the role of the Treaty of limiting {{balistiques}} {{(TAM),}} {{antimissiles}} and on the militarisation or arms of space.
The {{du}} {{du}} of the Canadian Security Centre on International Security has stressed the importance of the Treaty of {{«qui,}} {{depuis}} for more than 20 years, is essential for the security of {{et}} and it supported that neither Canada nor North America were threatened by {{tactiques.}} {{balistiques}}
Another aspect of the {{qui}} defence which is worthy of attention is the protection of {{et}} sovereignty and the control and defence of the territory, seas and air space.
Of course, such activities are exclusively in Canada and are dependent on the military resources that the country is prepared to {{consacrer.}}
However, we believe that, because of the importance of the high technology in the current and future military operations, the best way for Canada to protect itself is to work closely with the United States and to have access to information and technology that it offers {{NORAD.}}
As George {{(44:33),}} {{George}} Canada must continue to cooperate with the United States in order to be aware of the innovations in military and space technology.
There would also be an interest in integrating the military and civil control systems of air traffic which, although separate {{sont}} are already used in cooperation.
The committee recommends that Canada is preparing to renew the agreement of the {{et}} and calls for greater importance to be given to space surveillance than in international transport.
Canada should demand to be consulted on any measures to repeal the Treaty of limiting {{balistiques}} {{(TAM)}} {{ou}} or to place arms in space.
Safety in the Western {{occidental}} in 1984, Canada has become a full member of the Organisation of American States.
However, it has been excluded from any participation in the {{prévu}} security system, provided for in the Rio Treaty and Chapter 5 of the {{l'OEA.}} Charter.
This situation reflects a tradition of {{dans}} in Latin America issues.
However, a number of Canadian interventions have been recent recently.
For the first time, Canada sent troops in Central America with the United Nations group of observers and El Salvador for the United Nations observation mission.
For their part, {{ont,}} have established a better dialogue and cooperation between them on regional security and also welcomed the greater involvement of the United Nations in their region.
Canada has proposed a series of measures to control weapons to reduce the cost and size of the armed forces and defence in this sector.
It is also involved in annual conferences with {{navales}} {{et}} and air {{de}} of all of the world.
Earlier this year, a workshop took place on safety in Canada and Mexico.
Finally, Canada has launched the idea of a special committee for {{chargé}} to examine security issues.
In our opinion, Canada is well placed to play a useful role in {{sur}} in terms of security in general.
{{Klepak,}} {{de}} of the {{pour}} Foundation for the {{a}} supported that 'We have armed {{armées}} which are extremely professional and who do not want to intervene in the internal affairs of their countries, we have a very great deal of experience of maintaining peace, which is very much of interest to {{et}} and we have an {{dans}} experience in the area of the rights of the {{personne...}}
We have no {{historiques...}} {{historiques...}}
So we are very {{perçus.»}}
The Committee welcomes the efforts of the members of the Organisation of American States {{pour}} to increase their cooperation on security issues within the wider UN framework.
It supports the {{visant}} initiative to create a special committee for {{pour}} to examine these issues.
The proliferation of weapons with the end of the Cold War and the intensification of regional tensions is the result that the accumulation of conventional weapons at the end of the technology and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as the technology that {{sont}} have become serious issues of international importance.
The Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons {{entré}} entered into force in 1970 and now more than {{signataires,}} {{est}} is designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
As technology is making progress and becomes more accessible to example, {{mallette}} {{d'aujourd'hui,}} today, more powerful than the central {{central}} of the {{1960),}} {{les}} the means to produce nuclear weapons can only increase in turn, as is a worrying example of North Korea.
On the other hand, it is remarkable that none of the nations on the threshold of nuclear power had yet to say to be in possession of such a {{probablement}} probably because of fear of a {{chez}} among others.
At the same time, many of the states without nuclear weapons are {{de}} from what the {{avoués}} nuclear states did not do everything possible to reduce their {{et,}} and, in particular, have not been able to agree on a general ban on {{essais.}}
The renewal of the NPT in 1995 will probably not be compromise, but the Treaty alone will not be enough to resolve the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
In these circumstances, it seems to us that the strengthening of the NPT regime must be accompanied by additional international measures aimed at uniform application in order to discourage {{nucléaires}} states from making nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons and avoid reward the potential responsible for {{prolifération.}}
In the final analysis, the international community must strive to ban the tests at global level and adopt {{pour}} measures to prevent the use of nuclear weapons.
The Committee welcomes the conclusions of the Convention on the ban on chemical weapons and hopes that it will be implemented as soon as possible.
As far as the traditional weapons are concerned, the former opponents of the Cold War {{sur}} on the need to systematically restrict arms sales in order to avoid regional {{régionales}} and to limit the consequences of regional instability.
Unfortunately, there is a long way from the {{aux}}
In 1991, the United Nations General Assembly established the {{des}} {{conventionnelles,}} which requires Member States to provide data on certain imports and arms exports.
No provision is provided for {{mais}} but it is possible to determine by {{si}} if the imports declared by a country are in line with the export of others.
However, the system contains some {{:}} firstly, the Member States do not have all statements.
Secondly, it is not necessary to indicate the gender or to declare domestic production.
It is therefore important to have stricter controls on the import and export of landmines which have mainly hit the civilian population.
According to official estimates, there are still 85 to 100 million {{actives}} landmines in the world and, even if it costs 8 {{pour}} for {{il}} it costs 600 {{pour}} to {{chacune}} each {{d'elles.}}
The Committee believes that Canada, together with the countries that are the same opinion, should do everything possible to bring about more countries to sign the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons {{renforcer}} strengthening the {{TNP,}} regime to support the extension of the Treaty, to convince the nuclear powers of reducing the {{du}} extension of the Treaty, to convince nuclear powers to reduce their {{et}} and to continue the campaign for a total ban on nuclear testing.
Canada should insist that all Member States should be obliged to make statements on the {{des}} of the United Nations {{et}} and it should call for the internal markets to be {{aussi}}
It should also recommend the ban on arms sales to countries which do not present a statement to {{comme}} as the Canadian Committee of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations has {{recommandé.}}
The control of production, the import and export of landmines should be {{spéciaux.}}
{{pour}} for the Canadian {{canadiennes}} the Committee has heard very varied reports about the consequences for Canadian {{canadiennes}} changes which have been produced and will continue to be {{en}} in international security.
Some witnesses {{ex.}} {{Project}} {{Ploughshares)}} {{que}} propose that the emphasis is {{non}} not on military preparation but on development aid.
{{comme}} as the Congress of the {{préconisent}} associations advocates an increase in defence expenditure in order to have an immediate and immediate {{polyvalent}}
The Council of Canada suggests a {{conçue}} structure designed to protect territorial sovereignty and participate in the common security missions under the aegis of the United Nations when there is little risk of {{intenses.}} conflicts.
The Committee of the Rules of Procedure recommends a high military efficiency in the three elements of the forces, as well as modernisation of military equipment.
It is clear that the international security situation has changed and Canada must take account of these changes.
However, the areas of uncertainty are very {{nombreuses.}}
In any case, Canadian {{canadiennes}} are still necessary to fulfil certain tasks in the country.
In international terms, Canada does not provide any military threat, but the world has become much less {{prévisible.}}
Canada is no longer subject to the same constraints, but the decisions that it will take today will {{ses}} its armed forces for the 15 or 20 years.
It is very long and expensive to {{son}} its potential once it is lost.
It is much better to use non-military solutions to deal with disputes, but there is still no hope of a world without war.
It would therefore be {{comme}} as we have said in the light of the NATO seat to provide in conjunction with our allies, {{polyvalentes}} forces and prepared to fight for all of us to face up to any {{éventualité.}}
There are a number of options which are possible according to funding.
In the context of this budget {{budgétaire,}} there could be some {{par}} for example to reduce the number of active {{actifs}} and use the economies in order to increase the staff of certain {{ou}} units or to increase the number of support and transport vessels of transport and transport aircraft.
The current budget could be carried out in the current budget by establishing a better balance between the operational elements and the elements of the forces of the forces, reducing general costs, {{la}} construction, research and development and project management costs.
Other savings could be made by the selective reduction of the level of autonomy or the state of preparation of the forces.
According to safety experts, the {{encore}} even more {{limiteraient}} are actually {{effectivement}} the {{des}} of the forces and {{toute}} the important participation in operations abroad, whether for the UN or NATO.
Given the budgetary {{budgétaires,}} there will also be some options for {{spécialisation.}}
For example, we could increase the staff of certain specialised elements, such as logistics units and {{de}} communications and medical units in order to allocate additional units to peacekeeping operations and to reduce the staff of other elements which are less important for these same operations or other countries can provide more quickly.
On the other hand, the level of autonomy or the state of preparation for one or two of the {{combattantes}} weapons of Canadian {{canadiennes}} could be reduced {{le}}
For example, the state of preparation for the three {{des}} of land forces could be maintained at the current level, or even increased in response to the requirements of the concept of {{alors}} while the air and maritime forces could be reduced.
In our opinion, a reasonable degree of specialisation would be compatible with what the committee has heard in NATO.
We have been told that NATO itself was {{davantage,}} more in view of the current need to use smaller and more mobile forces for the crisis resolution and to maintain peace.
We have been told that the work of Canada in the area of the maintenance of peace was appreciated and that a {{du}} of Canada in peacekeeping operations under NATO activities would be welcome.
We believe that such a direction should be {{attentif.}}
In adopting such an option, however, we should avoid too much {{et}} and risk {{les}} the wrong tools in our {{quand}} when a crisis is {{une}}
The Committee believes that both in the interests of Canada and to maintain its reputation as a member of the international community, that Canada continues to contribute to strengthening international security.
It recommends that the Canadian armed {{armées}} should be given a more {{leur}} {{plus}} enabling them to better support peace operations.
However, the committee has reservations about excessive {{excessive}} of the armed {{armées}}
{{END}}
{{3:}} {{VERS}} {{UNE}} {{PROSPÉRITÉ}} {{COMMUNE}} {{et}} trade and international investment, as well as the financial arrangements that make it easier for them to be {{les}} {{influent}} influence a decisive role on wealth, prosperity and well-being of all {{Canadiens.}}
If the environment in which these activities are changing largely by others, the international economic policies adopted by Canadian governments can largely determine the action of Canada within this environment.
{{la}} prosperity and well-being are also dependent on the welfare of the other {{favorisées,}} populations, particularly those whose chances of life are most threatened by poverty.
In other words, as we have heard from the {{nous}} we have not only interests as a country, but also the values that we want and whose {{doivent}} must take into account the same as our interests, in the direction of our economic policies abroad.
These values lead us to {{entre}} among other things, to increase the condition and participation of women, to reduce poverty, to protect the environment at global level, to improve the working conditions of men and women and, finally, to ensure that the rights of the person are respected throughout the world.
The challenges as we have pointed out in the first chapter of this report, the current international economic situation is characterised by speeding up globalisation and integration.
The opening up of markets and the constraints imposed by the institutions and international agreements - for example the general agreement on customs tariffs and trade {{--}} - have an impact on national sovereignty.
In addition, trade and international investment are increasing so quickly that national governments, as well as the international institutions, will no longer be able to act on them in a way that is desirable in social terms.
We therefore believe that the United States, Europe and the countries of Asia are the main forces that are {{pour}} to change and {{le}} the context in which trade, finances and international investment in the medium and medium term.
The United States remains the only military superpower in the world and is among the three largest economic powers.
{{de}} the free world, the United States was now open to the world and resolutely in favour of a liberal world order.
But with the end of the Cold War and the {{de}} of their {{ils}} problems, they are now becoming increasingly {{sur}} and sensitive to the {{du}} of protectionism.
If the trend at international level is to limit the exercise of national sovereignty in the interests of greater international cooperation, the United States, and in particular Congress seems to be more often {{plus}} their right to impose their own rules.
{{il}} it will be more difficult to establish an international economic order based on rules, and Canada in particular will have some difficulty in managing its trade relations with its neighbours.
The European Union {{constitue}} is the dynamic core of a Europe whose economic and economic security will increase.
More and more countries are in the doors to join it.
The European Union is already at the forefront of the regions of the world for trade and investment, and its enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will create a market of 600 million people.
It could therefore play an important role in the world.
However, the {{de}} of Europe is still not sufficiently integrated and in order to allow the Union to speak with one voice.
Its members are very busy to build their own institutions and to deepen and extend their {{association.}}
The Union is therefore not yet able to exercise the influence of international trade in the form of international trade which would normally allow its size, wealth, culture and traditions.
The rise in Asia is undoubtedly the most important event at the end of the 21st century.
In the decade of the 1980s, the countries of {{ont}} have shown the growth rates more than twice the rest of the world.
With a population of almost EUR {{milliards}} billion people and a total gross national income twice higher than the European Union, these countries are of increasing importance both for Canada and for the global economy.
The {{estime}} Foundation believes that they are only {{p.}} 100 {{100}} of the population of the world, 50 {{100}} 100 of his production and 40 {{100}} 100 of its total consumption at the end of the century.
Many of them, who are {{une}} a {{il}} {{isolationniste}} there is still a long time to have liberalised their economies and open their doors to the direct investment of foreign companies and their markets to the rest of the world.
The accession of Japan has already been seen as a global power.
On the other hand, the newly industrialised economies are {{comme}} such as Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, but also Indonesia, {{et}} and Thailand are developing rapidly.
China, with a large population and internal savings and high growth, is to become an important economic power.
The same could happen in India.
These countries are all showing an extraordinary capacity to absorb production techniques and the forms of market organisation and have therefore shown considerable gains in terms of the productivity of factors which are reflected in the production of high-quality quality products in detail at very high prices.
{{de}} of all these factors will be part of the way in which these countries are {{des}} new ways of trade established by the new World Trade Organisation {{(OMC).}}
Although it is impossible to predict the future of Russia and the {{dont}} countries, whose long-term interests are, apart from the current {{actuelle,}} closely linked to those of Russia, it is likely that this country will also become an important economic power.
In a {{comptant}} world with giants such as the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Russia and perhaps India will succeed in preserving its interests if it manages to develop the economic links that it has with all these partners.
Despite the efforts made by the trade negotiators since the 1980s, which have led not only to the recent entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement {{(ALÉNA)}} {{mais}} but also to the success of the Uruguay Round of the GATT - the Committee does not believe that we have a satisfactory framework for the {{en}} policy on external trade.
It is not the time to rely on our {{lauriers.}}
In fact, {{doivent}} must redouble their efforts at international level as well as at the internal level, in order to strengthen their {{concurrentiels.}} benefits.
They also need to be vigilant and vigorously counter protectionist pressure, especially those from the United States.
This is important not only for the export sectors or private exporters but for all {{préoccupés}} concerned about the employment and social security system.
The {{rondes}} {{rondes}} on relations between Canada and the United States and on trade issues, as well as the {{soumis}} submitted by business people and others about international economic issues, confirmed in our opinion that the task we are waiting for is difficult and {{:}}
Let us ensure that the agreements concluded are properly {{oeuvre;}}
The development of better international rules on {{(par}} issues for example, dumping, {{la}} competition and environmental regulation, labour standards, labour standards, the rights of {{etc.);}} {{etc.);}}
To remedy the internal weaknesses which hamper diversification and expansion of {{et}} and to ensure that the objectives of trade policy and the wider foreign policy are mutually {{mutuellement.}}
In this respect, the challenges are both the short and long term.
In this report, we will follow the following approach.
First of all, we will distinguish between trade and investment, on the one hand, and finance on the other.
We know very well that these phenomena are closely linked but we believe that this distinction allows greater clarity.
Secondly, we will make a distinction between the short term and the long term.
This is also an artificial distinction because some of us are still in the short term, and the action of the {{est,}} is almost always dictated by short-term considerations.
However, this distinction has the advantage of making it possible to define the pressing problems of order in our financial situation, to improve the efficiency of commercial promotion and to react to US laws on the use of long-term use in the context of long-term objectives of long-term objectives.
{{un}} a liberal multilateral economic order based on {{et}} and creating and promoting in Canada a favourable direction for trade {{international),}}
What will help us choose short-term solutions that are the best long-term potential.
The long-term trade and investment priorities in the longer term, the government must continue with two fundamental objectives, to reaffirm the priority of a liberal and multilateral economic order {{par}} by rules and to create and promote international orientation in the companies of {{canadiennes.}}
The two tasks must be done without delay and priority if we want to maintain the welfare of {{et}} and the economic role of Canada in the world.
The two objectives are the immediate problems on which we have been {{penchés.}}
A multilateral system based on rules remains for Canada the best {{contre}} against the harsh {{durs}} of the big {{joueurs.}}
Indeed, it makes it possible to restrict the United States and increase the position of Canada in its unequal relationship with its neighbour.
More generally, such an economic order offers the safest way of making the best possible distribution of the resources at global level.
This is indeed the only way to ensure that the benefits of trade and the training of capital, as well as their {{d'ordre}} economic {{technologique,}} benefit the poorer regions of the world.
Needless to say, the barriers that rich countries such as Canada are making against exports from developing countries have nothing to do with this objective.
As the Institute of {{c'est}} has shown, this is an area where more could be done to liberalise the access of developing countries to the internal market, which could be seen as a development tool.
Another aspect of globalisation - the growing mobility of capital - has great repercussions on issues such as environmental standards, working conditions and social services.
These are policies and programmes that cost the governments and taxpayers that are expensive for the governments and taxpayers and, in this way, enter into the calculation of {{d'entreprise.}}
There is also a tendency to give priority to the Member States where these costs are the lowest costs.
It is in the institutions and multilateral negotiations that we can raise these problems and try to {{cette}} this natural trend to the {{par}}
Instead, we should exercise the policies and standards that have been put on the increase in an increase in the {{viser}} which is necessarily aimed at harmonisation or convergence of {{et}} and that it will restrict trade in order not to give new {{à}} to the adoption of protectionism.
It is difficult to know how the new multilateral order will take place in trade and investment matters.
At the summit of {{de}} in {{les}} the United States proposed to be the great pleasure of Canada, {{dans}} in the wake of the success of the Uruguay Round, a new effort to liberalise trade - the so-called {{2000»),}} open {{2000»),}} {{«Ronde}} a {{de}} of the Uruguay Round.
However, the summit has led to a much lower formula for further liberalisation.
On the other hand, there is a great deal of discussion about the future programme of the new WTO and at the time when it is established {{est}} is supposed to replace the GATT {{prochaine).}}
Is it perhaps going to deal with tariff reductions and trade and competition policy, but how will there be other outstanding issues such as additional reductions on agricultural products {{les}} public supplies, environmental standards, working conditions and the accession of new {{membres?}}
Under the last report, the main candidate is China, which seeks to be able to recognise the GATT as a developing country.
But we are asking it to fulfil all the {{du}} conditions in particular to comply with the provisions on customs tariffs and commercial practices and to respect acceptable standards in terms of {{main-d'oeuvre.}}
These are some of the questions on which Canada will have to prepare for the guidelines in principle for the meeting of the {{Asie-Pacifique}} Economic Cooperation Organisation {{à}} {{Jakarta,}} in November and the {{des}} of {{auquel}} {{Miami,}} which all democratic leaders in the Western {{occidental}} in December.
In order to improve the position of Canada on international trade at global level, the committee recommends what is {{:}}
The government should make the notion of a multilateral system based on rules on the first principle of Canada policy on international trade.
Let us ensure that the current bilateral and regional trade agreements are complementary to the objectives of the multilateral agreements.
The possible impact of all new bilateral or regional negotiations on the current and future multilateral agreements in the field of trade {{international;}}
Canada, together with other countries, should ensure that the World Trade Organisation {{ait}} has a truly universal and multilateral nature and the greatest possible number of {{basées}} based on compliance with the generally generally standard standards.
Canada should insist that the WTO should pay its first attention to the export subsidies of agricultural products, standards relating to environmental protection and {{main-d'oeuvre,}}
Above all, the general issue of sanctions is the general issue.
And the particular problem of the worrying proliferation of {{antidumping;}} measures.
Canada should use all the opportunities to assert the principle of greater liberalisation of trade {{par}} by rules.
While insisting on the importance of multilateralism, we must recognise the reality of {{étant}} given that Canada is committed to a process of economic integration in North America and that regional pressure will not be {{dans}} in the Western Balkans.
This trend has {{du}} from the lack of the services sector in the GATT negotiations {{l'Uruguay}} the Uruguay Round and the will of the United States, the European Union {{et}} and other industrialised countries to include trade in services and access to services in services by direct foreign investment {{(IED).}}
Regional arrangements such as Europe in 1992, the {{l'accord}} Agreement and {{ont}} have followed and influenced the GATT objectives.
They have also had the effect of adding to the GATT agenda of the issues of negotiation such as intellectual property rights relating to {{et}} trade and the measures on the investment of trade in trade.
In {{les}} regional blocs have increased {{CARICOM,}} {{le}} the {{et}} Group and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because we are aware of the potential for economic growth inherent in the opening of the markets of neighbouring countries or share the same views.
The question arises as to whether {{doit}} should continue to confine itself to Canada, Mexico and the United States, if it is to be extended to other countries of {{voire}} or even those of the Pacific {{du}} or whether the members of the {{doivent}} must negotiate their own bilateral trade agreements with {{non-signataires.}}
In view of the emphasis that we call for multilateralism, it would be much better to extend regional free trade through the accession of new members to {{l'ALÉNA.}}
Otherwise, the {{pourrait}} could become a {{bigarré}} {{d'arrangements}} bilateral {{bilatéraux,}} which will lead to the United States to formulate new requirements and to jeopardise the gains achieved by {{à}} namely the dispute settlement mechanism and parallel agreements on environmental standards and working conditions.
On the other hand, we must admit that {{lui-même}} itself will work more in {{qu'en}} than in the triangle as long as the exchange of trade is {{faibles.}}
In addition, Mexico is growing rapidly.
At the same time, Mexico is already trying to conclude limited bilateral agreements with several other Latin American countries, and nothing does not prevent the United States from doing so if they think it is useful.
Canada must therefore not be allowed to abandon any possibility of international trade and not hesitate to negotiate bilateral agreements to strengthen its trade links with the countries of the {{mais}} but in the context of a {{ouvert».}} {{ouvert».}}
In view of the commitment of Canada on regional trade, the committee recommends that the government has a policy of two aspects of supporting the enlargement of {{à}} to other countries.
While strengthening its political and economic presence in Latin America, and by trying to develop its trade relations with Mexico and other trade partners.
Canada must also be very present in the countries of the {{si}} region that are so {{dynamiques.}}
It must develop its strong points and think in the short and long term.
In doing so, it will have to review the economic and commercial arrangements both bilateral and multilateral and that it has with these countries in the light of the major economic changes that they currently have.
The committee recognises that the expansion of new institutions, such as the Organisation of Economic Cooperation {{(APEC),}} {{sera}} will be an increasingly important element of international trade and economic relations with these countries.
{{est}} is a relatively recent phenomenon such as explosive growth in the region.
But since its creation, five years ago, it has become a privileged place in the region and discussions on economic interdependence and the multilateral trade system and the lowering of barriers to trade in goods, services and investment.
It has also become an important {{de}} of cooperation towards sectoral issues, including environmental protection.
We recommend that the government is actively seeking trade prospects in the {{Asie-Pacifique.}} region.
Its success will depend on its ability to make better use of the markets in the region and to take specific initiatives to make a greater comparative advantage of the exporters of {{canadiens.}}
In our opinion, in any long-term strategy to meet the challenges of globalisation, the government and the private sector should give itself a priority objective to encourage companies to give themselves a international approach.
To this end, awareness of foreign markets and their linguistic and cultural characteristics must be an integral part of the efforts to develop businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises and medium-sized enterprises.
We also need to invest in two closely {{:}} objectives.
Let us do better to know Canada in {{étrangers;}}
Let us do better to know the world on the {{Canadiens.}}
The knowledge of the market is not enough and will not be properly {{en}} depending on the long-term interests of Canada.
The government is required in several areas, for example, to stimulate essential scientific and technical efforts to the future success of our external trade.
This is an important dimension which must be dealt with more closely by the trade representatives of Canada.
People working in the fields of education, research and development have made us a great deal of conviction in their desire to participate in this effort.
Another dimension that needs to be strengthened is perhaps the most effective way for the most effective marketing of all of them, the dissemination of {{de}} of culture and knowledge.
This tool could not only be better to make it clear to us and to make the other countries more aware of this, but also to generate a climate of confidence and understanding of sustainable trade relations.
It is a tool that has proved its evidence and that many of our competitors have a large {{parti.}}
It is not the instruments that are lacking in such a policy.
The Canadian trade delegations at ministerial level could be accompanied by {{qui}} who often enjoy a greater reputation than members of the government and the business world.
{{créateurs}} artists could be invited to participate abroad in commercial {{commerciales.}}
We could encourage exchanges of teachers and {{d'étudiants.}}
{{et}} and universities could be encouraged to provide {{ou}} or to organise workshops to find {{sur}} on the possibilities of making business {{l'étranger}}
{{s'inspirant,}} for example, a Japanese government programme within which people are {{par}} by transnational companies study in Japan with the assurance that they will have a job in their transnational society after their {{diplôme).}}
Finally, there could also be closer cooperation between the Canadian cultural centres abroad and the promotion of the promotion programmes.
The Committee has repeatedly said that the lack of control of foreign languages and knowledge of foreign cultures is often an obstacle to the {{et}} and penetration of foreign markets.
However, Canada has an important and growing area of people who speak English and French and who know many other languages and cultures.
There should be a better party of this resource and encourage language learning and foreign cultures, particularly in commercial schools and the administrative skills of businesses.
It goes without saying that any programme aimed at giving companies an international orientation must be based on a strong national community of the {{de}} of culture and education and to have an effective strategy for improving these activities in order to make the products abroad.
The Federal Government can do a lot in this direction, but the cooperation of provinces is essential in view of their sphere of competence and their international activities in this area.
We are dealing more in detail with this issue in Chapter 6 on culture and education.
However, we should like to point out that this is the importance of these elements in order to strengthen the potential of Canada as a {{commerçant}} country.
The committee recommends that the government should draw up a long-term plan in order to bring companies to an international {{internationale,}} which is {{dans}} within the framework of an integrated trade strategy and would be the result of cooperation with interested governments.
higher education institutions and cultural institutions, as well as companies should participate in this strategy.
We also recommend that the government should be given the commitment of the provinces at a joint plan to create {{des}} programmes and other programmes designed to create an Canadian {{canadiens}} {{vers}} on abroad.
{{La}} trade is {{dans}} in the principle of {{la}} most {{depuis}} since the Second World War.
There are many who are calling for Canada and other countries to impose {{aux}} conditions for relations with them.
In fact, they have a discrimination against countries where the rights of the person are violated against the environment, {{les}} the environment, women and children or {{les}} trade unions.
In its memory the {{du}} {{du}} Congress calls on Canada to include the bilateral trade agreements of workers' rights and to seek to promote the adoption of a provision on social rights and workers' rights within the WTO.
Those responsible for the programmes for the value of the human resources of four other trade unions have {{dans}} in a memory presented jointly that Canada is considering the granting of the benefits of the general tariffs system to respect for workers' rights.
There are two considerations here.
In the short term, {{doivent}} countries must have the weight of {{réprobation}} and the decisions of the international community.
In the long term, trade, trade and dialogue will help promote political reforms and respect for the rights of the individual.
Trade sanctions can be justified in certain cases against serious abuse, but only when they are applied by a decisive majority of trade partners, such as the case for South Africa.
But in general, we believe that Canada can have a beneficial influence on other countries in dealing with them openly by making it clear to its views by dialogue.
The comments that we have made in this regard are international and the {{des}} Network involved in international rights deserve to be duly taken into account.
There are no alternative solutions to threats and sanctions.
It is also important that we be consistent in the application of our principles, starting with the implementation of our principles.
In addition, it is always more effective to work together with friends than they do alone.
As soon as the WTO is set up, Canada should draw the attention of this body not only on the subject of the {{dont}} trade that has been mentioned.
But on the problems associated with trade and investment when higher yields attract capital in countries where there are hardly social programmes or environmental protection programmes.
A {{laisser-faire}} attitude in this area would give us too easily a competitive competitive advantage to those countries that violate the rights of the {{reconnus,}}
When they close the eyes to forced labour and the exploitation of children and women and refuse to adopt international labour standards on which a large number of countries are already {{d'adopter}}
- {{ex.}} {{dans}} in the framework of the International Labour Organisation
The lack of good multilateral rules could lead to the erosion of the programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the people, simply due to the will to retain costs to the cost of the capital that is {{s'en}}
At the end of the day, this is the survival of our trade relations.
Indeed, if a country does not respect the fundamental rights of its citizens, there is a need to ask whether it will be possible to respect the rights of foreign investors.
Therefore, in accordance with the values expressed with conviction by the {{le}} the committee recommends that the government of Canada choose the most effective routes to protest against serious violations of the rights of the individual, labour standards and the principles of environmental protection, where they occur.
It is working closely when possible, with its partners who share the same views in order to obtain {{d'une}} in a way compatible with the {{d'un}} development of a multilateral trade trading system.
Trade sanctions in a multilateral context should be considered in a multilateral context.
{{Les}} international financial institutions {{--}} - the International Monetary Fund {{et}} and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development {{(BIRD)}}
In the last 50 years, which has been created in the {{Woods,}} {{Woods,}} and set up in the immediate period of {{ont}} have evolved in a {{depuis}} way.
There are more and more serious questions about the future of the system, structures and roles of this {{d'IFI}} {{--}} - the IMF, the World Bank, the regional development banks and the Bank of International {{internationaux}}
This development does not mean that the overall context in which these institutions work has been {{comme}} as we have already pointed out.
The capital has become far more mobile and increased interdependence has increased the efforts of international cooperation.
The multilateral institutions have {{et}} and many non-governmental players have joined governments on the international stage.
The {{ont}} reacted in {{leur}} their mandate and have had more organisational organisational structures.
The {{s'est}} was quickly {{de}} from the {{d'après-guerre}} Europe to focus on the developing world, and it has {{comme}} as a member of the current group of the World Bank.
This also includes the International Development Association {{internationale}} the International Financial Society and the multilateral investment guarantee agency.
{{ont}} have been the subject of many complaints before the {{Comité.}}
In the eyes of many people, they have become undemocratic and bureaucratic {{non}} which are not sufficiently accessible, open or responsible, and who are developing in a world to them.
This is very isolated from competition considerations and the concerns of ordinary people.
In particular, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with their lack of sensitivity for these concerns and their lack of public transparency with regard to the methods used to develop and implement structural adjustment policies.
Some criticisms have been very severe and show the loss of public confidence and the risk of undermining the {{les}} support of the multilateral institutions in general.
The {{a}} {{Nord-Sud}} has reported these concerns in the detailed reform proposals that it presented to the {{Comité.}}
According to the {{il}} pressure should be made for changes in the operation of the banks, in order to reduce administrative costs, to improve the responsibility of the developing countries, to increase the participation of developing countries, and to encourage policies that promote {{pauvres».}}
{{pour}} for foreign policy {{p.}} {{28.)}} {{28.)}}
We agree that this is a matter which deserves to be seen as a priority.
The Bank and the IMF must of course be accountable to the Member States of these {{de}} organisations in {{surtout}} especially the richest and the most powerful who are represented in their {{respectif.}} {{respectif.}}
It is not directly to the parliaments, and even less to the citizens, that their responsibility is that obligation.
In the administration boards of the Bank and the IMF, the number of votes in each country is {{en}} depending on the amount of the contribution of everyone to the {{roulement.}} fund.
However, the current distribution of votes no longer respects the principle of economic {{économique}}
There is no doubt that the {{ont}} procedures have left to be desired before, even though the Bank and the IMF have made serious efforts to correct them in recent years.
It is therefore important to support and strengthen the measures taken in this respect, such as the creation of the World Bank {{de}}
However, there is probably a way to further improve transparency.
In particular, we could call on the Canadian {{canadiens}} of the Bank, the IMF and the regional development banks to be more {{peut-être}} perhaps once a year before the committees of Parliament responsible for foreign and finance affairs.
More generally, we believe that it is time to carry out a thorough review of all the activities of the {{et}} and their respective contribution to achieving the multilateral objectives.
This review should be open to all interested parties, government or not, and it should take account of the concerns of those affected by the operations of the {{IFI.}}
We will deal with the proposals for reform of the Bretton Woods system.
The committee has also taken up another question, namely the {{qu'entretiennent}} reports with the United Nations system.
Although the Bank and the IMF have officially taken part in this system, they do not do so, unlike the institutions that are the subject of examination from the Economic and Social Council or the United Nations General Assembly, which has caused some complaints.
On the other hand, we can ask ourselves whether it would be in the interests of effective and responsible management of the {{aux}} of the United Nations directives or whether it would only {{qu'à}} their operation.
We do not have a solution, but we agree that greater cooperation and coherence between the UN bodies and those of the Bretton Woods system - including in the future the World Trade Organisation, are a long-term objective.
It is at least worth considering the proposals such as those of the {{concernant}} Institute on the creation of a {{mondial».}} economic {{économique}}
As an average {{moyenne}} part of the board of all {{le}} Canada is well placed to present innovative ideas in this regard.
As we have already mentioned, the issue of the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions has been a {{animé.}} debate.
We had a completely different responsibility for the World Bank and the IMF of responsibilities which are entirely different but complementary to a degree of coordination.
The IMF was given three fundamental {{:}}
{{les}} countries to adopt the {{de}} of {{monnaie;}}
{{un}} a fixed exchange rate system but {{coordonner}}
And help Member States to deal with the temporary imbalances of their balance of payments.
Over the years, the IMF has given the exchange rate exchange rates.
In order to remedy the financial crises that have {{en}} in particular in developing countries, the IMF has placed emphasis on the adoption by the Member States with serious imbalances in their balance of payments.
{{de}} macroeconomic stabilisation measures and long-term structural adjustment programmes in order to deal with monetary problems and counter the brain drain are among the main obstacles to the restoration of a country's financial health.
The main responsibility for the World Bank was and remains the money for the governments of the developing countries, which cannot take what they need on the global financial market.
In order to ensure the reimbursement of loans, the Bank has had to take more and more action on the action of the IMF and {{une}} a good proportion of its loans to the adoption of structural adjustment programmes.
It should be noted that experience has been {{pour}} for the World Bank.
If the volume of aid has {{les}} private capital contributions to developing countries have {{la}} the {{de}} so that the total amount of financial resources for these countries has reached unprecedented levels.
It is important to review this issue.
{{la}} the main difference between the IMF mandate and the World Bank is that the fund is responsible for dealing with financial {{financières,}} while the Bank is dealing with long-term development.
However, in view of the points of view he has heard, the committee believes that there should be a clearer distinction between the functions of the Bank and those of the IMF.
And that it should pay more attention to the fiscal performance of the {{et}} and the need for all countries, not just for developing countries, to show macroeconomic discipline and to carry out {{ajustements.}}
For its part, the Bank should continue to improve its ability to take more account of the social and environmental costs in drawing up its structural adjustment programmes when they are necessary.
In this respect, it should take seriously the contribution of non-governmental organisations to the question of fair development, democratic and sustainable development.
To dispel misunderstandings and {{ces}} these two institutions could benefit from greater accessibility through dialogue and mechanisms.
In Washington, the Committee was aware of various proposals for reform of the institutions.
They {{les}} the following {{suivants}}
The creation of a system of targets for the exchange rate of the main {{système}} system managed through the {{FMI;}}
Greater international cooperation in order to regulate and supervise financial markets, through the {{FMI;}}
The more extensive institutional measures in direct international investment are through the World Trade Organisation or a new investment body for {{mondial;}}
Finally, an important enlargement of the role of regional bodies {{de}} {{l'APEC).}}
It is true that some of these suggestions are likely to be {{notamment}} particularly the idea of {{cibles,}} {{mais}} but they will have to be taken seriously in view of the forthcoming {{G-7}} Summit in {{Halifax.}}
Despite the fact that the forthcoming summit must be held in Canada, it has been said that Canada had lost influence in the {{G-7.}}
In the document it prepared for the {{Sylvia}} {{Ostry}} {{Ostry}} {{cette}} this situation at the low economic efficiency of Canada and the limited role it plays in the international economy.
For this reason, it recommends to Canada to resume the initiative by proposing an {{touchant}} change plan, affecting the {{G-7}} countries.
The development of a comprehensive safety programme for {{(aide,}} summits for the environment, trade and investment, {{coordination}} {{de}}
{{entre}} between the OECD, the World Bank, the IMF and the {{l'OMC;}}
New ways of sharing responsibilities and distribution of certain issues between the different countries.
The performance assessment system by the Member States, which would lead to the participation of {{spécialisés.}} ministers.
In addition, the Committee believes that international financial markets must be subject to international supervision.
At the moment, they are quite {{et}} and completely {{totalement}} the regulation of governments.
In order to resolve this serious problem, the countries must be prepared to coordinate their efforts in the area of national policy and to agree on the most important institutions to take responsibility in this area.
The IMF is possible, provided that it is reformed.
Another solution would be to tax transactions in foreign currency.
Our point is not to determine the merits of all the proposals made in the various {{tribunes,}}
But we believe that Canada has every interest in taking part in this debate and to make it heard in the multilateral discussions that will take place on the reform of the institutions and the development of the global economy.
As a result, the committee recommends that the government, in its study of the reform of the Bretton Woods system, in preparation for the {{établisse}} Summit establishes a strategy for the World Trade Organisation {{à}} to the Organisation for Cooperation and Economic Development {{ainsi}} as well as the international financial institutions, the strategy to maintain the active role of Canada in a global economy based on rules.
This strategy should be submitted to Parliament and examined by the permanent permanent committees.
The committee also recommends that any study of the operations of the international financial institutions will be comprehensive and that it concerns the way in which the tasks between the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are clearly distributed and the relations of these institutions with other institutions such as regional development banks.
In particular, we should try to make their operations more effective, more transparent, more responsible and more sensitive to the principles of respect for the rights of the individual, social justice, the preservation of the environment and the participation of local populations.
Finally, the committee recommends that the Canadian ministers concerned, as well as the Canadian {{canadiens}} of the World Bank, the IMF and the regional development banks will be invited once a year before the parliamentary committees responsible for foreign affairs and finance in order to account for the activities of these institutions.
Finally, the committee also wants to deal briefly with the issue of the debt of developing countries, which has been the subject of a large number of {{d'interventions.}}
There have been a number of reports from the two chambers of parliamentary committees from both {{ont}} and the last study of the year 1990.
As we have said earlier, there has been a significant resumption of private capital contribution in developing countries in recent years.
The financial situation has improved in most countries with the exception of Africa.
However, the committee recognises that {{est}} debt is enormous and that some small countries particularly from sub-Saharan Africa are far from the crisis.
These same countries are probably among those who will benefit the least from the liberalisation of trade, and they are also taken with many other problems.
Canada has already taken the {{de}} of debt to some countries, but the Committee is of the opinion that it is important to consider other bilateral and multilateral actions to remedy the crisis of the poorest countries in particular, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, these measures must not jeopardise the funding of long-term development aid.

It is at the heart of their identity, their relationship with their vast territory, their economy which traditionally depends on natural resources and, in many respects, their way of life.
The Committee has heard many witnesses about the importance of sustainable development.
The representatives of the North authorities made it clear that cross-border pollution was responsible for increased health problems.
{{sur}} {{saisissants}} on the state of the oceans and the high sea fishing have been very impressed by the members of the {{Comité.}}
For a number of witnesses which have {{devant}} before the {{il}} it is increasingly obvious that the environmental impact is becoming a global dimension and affects life and welfare and the future of all {{Canadiens.}}
The {{de}} of the ozone {{d'ozone,}} climate change caused by the greenhouse effect, soil pollution, water and air and the accelerated destruction of biodiversity and key ecosystems are undeniable evidence of the international dimension of everyday life.
The general objective of sustainable development - which is to meet the current needs of the population without reducing the capacity for future generations to respond to their own needs - is now firmly anchored in the collective conscience of the {{Canadiens.}}
The particular importance of the {{au}} to sustainable development is for many factors to be {{L'importance}}

To hear the groups of young people, the environmental bodies and the Community and commercial associations, the committee has made a clear impression that the protection of the environment was an expression of the fundamental values of the {{canadienne.}} population.
It was surprised that the various sectors of our society will be able to take account of environmental concerns when taking economic and social decisions, and how much this could support the {{à}} to a common cause.
The stakes are clear.
As {{MacNeill}} {{à}} has said, the world continues to {{tête}} the {{baissée}} {{baissée}} without being concerned about the environment.
The world is at the expense of our natural resources.

In addition, what we are {{la}} the way in which we produce and what we can export from the international community, as can the forestry industry be {{l'industrie}}
It is essential to draw up common rules in the field of trade and the environment in order to minimise the natural trend to the {{par}} of {{(dont}} which has been raised in Chapter {{et}} and in order to prevent the environment from being used as a pretext for building protectionist barriers.
For the {{Board}} {{du}} of Canada, sustainable development is a great challenge, but also a good opportunity to {{saisir.}}
In general, a positive relationship between the environment and the economy is {{l'établissement}}
An increasing number of cases of business are convinced that the environmental conservation techniques put in place by Canada, and the fact that Canada is perceived as a leader in this area, can open up new markets for Canada and play a key role in the competitiveness of the country.
The {{sur}} national round of the environment and the economy has made its conviction that all members of the committee also share the {{:}}
By highlighting {{réciprocité}} reciprocity of a relationship between the economy and the environment, sustainable development can guide the foreign policy so that it will {{la}} the creation of jobs in Europe, while expressing the profound meaning of the community and the responsibility that {{entretiennent}} have to the rest of the world.
We are encouraging the recent decision to promote the ecological industry at international level.
As the environmental problems have a global dimension, we know that the efforts of a single country cannot be enough.
In the {{du}} of the {{tenu}} Summit in Brazil in 1992, we see the foundations for an international system of rules and institutions for sustainable development.

There is an urgent need for political impetus to continue to move forward in this matter.
In this regard, we need to take full advantage of the opportunities for the forthcoming multilateral meetings of the United Nations, such as the social development summit and the conference on women in {{Beijing.}}
{{Ostry,}} {{de}} of the University of {{a}} described sustainable development as {{plus}} the greatest challenge to the transformation of {{(6:8).}} {{(6:8).}}
In a memory presented to the {{la}} the {{sur}} Round on the environment and the economy states that Canada needs a thematic centre and a philosophical basis for recognising the new opportunities and {{dans}} in difficult choices to be done.
The concept of sustainable development provides this centre and this basis.
It offers integration, supported by the people and national power, to define the foreign policy of Canada in the 1990s.
The Committee is convinced that the concept of sustainable development must be a key guiding theme of foreign policy and that it is at stake in all its main aspects.
Sustainable development is essential for the well-being of {{à}} our national, regional and global security.
He has a very good report with our trade and economic relations and is part of the image of {{à}} {{l'étranger.}} abroad.
It is on the basis of Canada cooperation on development.
The {{rondes}} and other consultation mechanisms have shown that it is possible to harmonise the interests of the business world, governments, indigenous groups and NGOs.
We must invest in these {{et}} and ensure that we are going to take action.
Sustainable development has led to new alliances and new ways to address common problems, which is very important at a time when Canada has difficulty in fulfilling its international obligations in the field of the environment because of the financial restrictions.
The Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
In order to make the bilateral institutions, regional and multilateral institutions more effective and force them to make them more aware and increase their ability to promote sustainable development.
{{les}} the links between trade and sustainable development through the World Trade Organisation.
The Committee is convinced that the adoption of clear international rules and standards will help to help the cause of sustainable development, and to reduce the current trend of certain countries to invoke the environmental argument to justify {{commercial.}}
The international development of sustainable development has produced a series of useful principles to guide work in this {{domaine;}}
To put in place mechanisms to ensure close coordination of national and international policies on sustainable development, including the {{de}} together with the interested parties, of consultation mechanisms {{l'action;}}
Let us give priority to the implementation of the strategy of the environment industries.

To ensure that the relevant foreign policies are assessed according to their possible repercussions on the development of {{durable;}}
To establish links between sustainable development, poverty, democracy and the good government.
On the basis of the principle that the lines behind foreign policy, the committee is looking at the two sections that follow the issue of the oceans and the Arctic.
A policy of the Arctic and the end of the Cold War has opened the way for a host of opportunities, which were previously {{auparavant,}} in terms of cooperation between the countries of the Arctic region.
It has become possible for the first time to look at things from a {{sous}} point of view in the form of cooperation between countries and peoples of the east and the West which are experiencing experiences and similar problems.
The Committee has learned in {{que}} that the government of the {{du}} {{projetait}} will open up an office in {{(une}} {{ville}} of northern Russia to over 6 000 km of {{Moscou).}}
This is a concrete proof of the new relations that are being established in the Arctic.
The {{inuit}} {{a}} Conference has carried out an important preliminary work in this regard, by setting up cooperation programmes in the field of agriculture, health and education.
In addition, the Committee has heard impressive reports of indigenous bodies that confirm their willingness to play a greater role, particularly in the development of the Northern Dimension of international policy of Canada.
In the face of these new {{certains}} some have proposed the creation of a Arctic Council which would make a fundamental contribution to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference {{et}} and {{tous}} all countries bordering the Indian Ocean - Canada, Greenland and the United States.
His first dossier, the one which urgently makes the creation of the group, the environment.
{{exceptionnellement}} fragile is already threatened by the {{d'Europe}} pollution of Europe and Russia, which takes the form of {{arctique.}} {{arctique.}}
The radioactive waste and the reactors of reactors that the old Soviet regime has {{pendant}} for years in the rivers that are {{dans}} in the Arctic and the Ocean could have even more serious effects.
Canada should continue to encourage the United States to join with such advice as the first task would be to draw up uniform policies and programmes to protect the environment.
We recommend the government to cooperate urgently with other states to form a Arctic Council, one of the priorities would be to remove the dangers that threaten the Arctic environment.
The government appointed {{May}} {{Simon,}} {{fondatrice}} {{de}} of the {{circumpolaire}} {{circumpolaire}} {{circumpolaire}} {{d'ambassadeur}} {{d'ambassadeur}} {{d'ambassadeur}}
The committee approves this proposal.
It is because the new {{est}} is the person who has said to strengthen our sovereignty on Arctic waters and promote cooperation between the countries of the region, including the promotion of trade trade.
The indigenous peoples in the north of Canada are in the face of a particular problem because of measures taken by the European Union and the United States.
The European Union has banned imports of wild animals because it is opposed to the use of leghold traps and the United States adopted the law on the protection of marine {{marins.}}
The Convention on {{migrateurs,}} {{migrateurs,}} which was signed by Canada and the United States, has also been the subject of complaints.
Representatives of the indigenous peoples have pointed out to the Committee that these measures had indeed had the effect not only of reducing the revenue that they are {{de}} but also to prevent them from living in natural resources.
One of the first tasks of the Arctic Arctic {{pourra}} will therefore be to seek ways to alleviate the indigenous peoples of these constraints.
In addition, the Canadian Members who are involved in assemblies with representatives of the European Parliament and in meetings of the {{Canada-États-Unis}} interparliamentary group should take advantage of meetings with their colleagues to address these issues.
{{5:}} {{RENOUVELER}} {{L'AIDE}} {{INTERNATIONALE}} {{INTERNATIONALE}}
The first measure - {{le}} the mandate to the {{sur}} round on development aid, {{Rawkins}} {{a}} {{:}}
What the committee could make more useful would be to recognise that the Canadian development aid programme needs to be effective, rigorous and precise.
In general, we have the same view, even though the rigour and accuracy of the mandate should be resolved according to the complexity and {{du}} of the world.
The mandate of the {{est}} is currently a {{de}} of principles, policies and programme priorities.
The emphasis was in recent years on the relief of poverty, structural adjustment and the participation of women, environmentally friendly development and the supply of energy supply.
{{s'est}} has been a time of environmental sustainability, political, economic, social and cultural sustainability.
If a set of fundamental principles and priorities are to be {{un}} the committee is convinced that clarification of the {{l'ACDI}} mandate is the first and most important thing of measures to be taken to strengthen the aid programme.
As the OECD has pointed out, the legitimacy of public development aid is dependent on the clarity of objectives, the integrity of resources and the obligation to show results.
In order to clarify the mandate of {{nous}} we reaffirm the principle that aid is intended for the poorest people in the world.
Other principles will improve the immediate interests of Canada, but there is a lack of essential quality of credibility.
The successive opinion polls have shown that the {{de}} of aid based on immediate interests for example, including the promotion of {{n'ont}} have never {{les}}
{{les}} the most {{voilà}} this is the wording which is closely linked to the concept of development aid the vast majority of {{Canadiens.}}
As a result, the committee states that the Canadian development aid programme should be the primary objective of reducing poverty by means of effective action aimed at the poorest people in the countries that most need our assistance and which can take advantage of it.
This point of principles contains three {{:}}
The emphasis placed on the most {{pauvres;}} people.
The choice of beneficiary countries in accordance with their needs, which should be established, in our opinion, on the basis of more significant measures than simply GNP per {{et}}
The {{que}} that countries need to present a minimum absorption capacity of aid {{canadienne.}}
Of course, there are many ways of achieving as broad an objective as the reduction of poverty.
In its memory to the {{l'Institut}} the {{rappelle}} Institute reminds us that {{pauvreté}} is a much more complex reality than it is {{et}} and that {{soulagement}} {{la}} requires a whole range of {{stratégies».}}
We must not imagine that there is a single or simple strategy to help the poor, and not forget that the majority of the poorest people in the world do not have the least developed countries in the {{classifications}}
However, in the last 40 years we have learned to better distinguish between the means - that the President of {{appelle}} calls on the {{du}} of the spring of spring or {{des}} of vital issues.
There is now an unprecedented degree of consensus on the components of good development policy.
In the light of all the {{le}} the committee recommends that the Canadian aid programme should be used for sustainable development as a fundamental policy framework for the development of human potential.
This framework stems from two of the main lessons learned from experience, namely that development must focus on the welfare and development of the people and that it must continue itself.
The aid programme must be designed to help people {{eux-mêmes}} themselves and must be conducted as a genuine partnership based on a local consensus.
It is generally accepted that sustainable development is not possible without the following {{suivants}}
The basic services such as health, education, nutrition and {{logement;}}
A infrastructure infrastructure.
fair access to resources and determination to ensure their {{durabilité;}}
A legal and institutional framework including the rights of the individual, democratic development and sound management of {{publique;}}
Access to jobs and sustainable income.
It is in this spirit that the committee has looked at the priorities of the programme.
In view of the scarcity of resources, our efforts must not be {{nos}}
The current policy framework of {{englobe}} covers the main development of sustainable development, but without clear clearly the areas where Canada should focus its {{énergies.}}
The Committee believes that priority should be given to the six areas following the following areas in which we do not lose sight of the fact that, in order to be effective, development aid must be based on sound government policy, institutions which can and the proper provision of services and services are {{des}}
The essential needs.
The Committee has heard witnesses that most of the {{serve}} should be used to meet the essential needs.
The committee agrees that more emphasis needs to be placed on health care, basic education, food, housing, water and {{et}} and that special attention must be paid to the needs of disabled and vulnerable groups.
At the same time, it recognises that there is no magic intervention {{«l'éducation}} {{«l'éducation}} or {{et}} and the {{salubrité».}}
{{à}} actions have their importance, but when the price of raw materials is {{l'inflation}} inflation is {{les}} public finances are {{ou}} or natural resources are {{elles}} they do not solve very much.
In relation to the current share of less than 20 {{100}} 100 % of {{le}} the committee recommends that the key needs are at least 25 {{100}} 100 {{l'APD.}}
The rights of the individual, sound public management and democratic development.
Poverty and unsustainable development are inextricably linked to access to power.
As long as the people will not be able to participate actively in making decisions on development, they will remain {{marginalisées.}}
Special attention must be paid to building democratic institutions capable of adapting to the rapid development of civil societies throughout the world.
The International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development has an important role to play in this area, together with {{d'autres}} other ministries and NGOs.
Women's participation.
Improving women and equal status for women in society are fundamental aspects of sustainable development.
To this end, we need to {{entre}} among other things, the training of {{les}} health services and the reform of legal systems and strengthening women's organisations.
In addition, women must be involved in all sectoral programmes as the participants and beneficiaries of development.
It is widely established that the improvement of the female condition has great benefits, because it is an improvement in the standard of living of families, a reduction in {{et}} and better economic growth.
The preservation of the environment.
There is a close link between the environment, poverty and democracy.
The committee would like to point out the contribution of the Research Centre for the International Development Centre which has high quality work on the basis of the sustainable development programme agreed in Rio at the {{Terre.}} Summit.
We believe that {{doit}} must pay particular attention to the {{aux}} problems of cross-border pollution and renewable resources such as forests, fishing and water resources.
These are areas where the expertise of Canada well with the needs of developing countries.
The development of the private sector.
Health and education do not mean much if there are no jobs or income.
{{doit}} must strengthen the framework for the development of the private sector in developing countries and support the {{coopératives,}}
{{comme}} programmes such as those supported by {{Bank,}} {{et}} and small and medium-sized enterprises are best able to create jobs.
Public participation.
In the final analysis, the continuation of the cooperation in international development is dependent on such {{que}} as compassion and understanding.
Public participation is one of the means to mobilise {{en}} for international development.
In order to promote closer cooperation and better understanding, we need to increase the resources that it {{aux}} to study {{d'étude}} and exchange programmes {{Jeunesse}} {{Canada}} {{Canada}} {{Canada}}
In short, the committee recommends that official aid to the development of Canada on six {{:}}
{{besoins}} needs
The rights of the individual, sound public management and development of development.
{{des}} participation
The preservation of the environment.
Development of the sector
Public participation and participation
Let us turn to the last of the elements that we believe essential to clarify the mandate of the {{soit}} or a legal framework.
There are two ways of dealing with this issue.
On the one hand, a law would reduce {{et}} and the flexibility of {{deux}} two essential {{essentielles.}}
Many of the advantages of a law - such as greater transparency - can be acquired by other means by increasing the role of Parliament, for example.
On the other hand, the fact that the effective adaptation of {{ne}} can only be achieved within a framework of common and sustainable objectives, which has always been {{milite}} in favour of a law.
In the eyes of the {{une}} a {{forcerait}} law to make accounts and {{l'APD}} {{canadienne}} {{d'influences}} {{aléatoires}} {{indues.}} or {{indues.}}
By calling for a legislative framework, the committee does not propose that there should be {{l'APD}} {{et}} and {{:}} {{de}} that would actually be a {{force.}} of force.
Instead, it would be to set the fundamental principles of the aid programme in terms that speak for {{Canadiens.}}
{{et}} and {{canadienne}} {{en}} in general, therefore need the stability that the great principles will remain valid beyond the {{du}} of spring or {{l'automne».}}
Therefore, the committee recommends that Parliament adopt a law laying down the fundamental principles of public development aid.
Finally, Parliament should closely follow the implementation of the law.
The committee recommends that the Standing Committee of the House of Commons on Foreign Affairs and International Trade or the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs are trying to make regular {{réguliers}}
There should not be a few {{le}} the status of the world.
The second measure - {{entre}} between aid and trade the committee is convinced that the distinction between aid and promotion of trade is one of the major problems in the aid programme.
On this subject, we have noted the following opinion of the general {{général}} in his 1993 report, following a thorough examination of the bilateral {{l'ACDI}} programmes in several countries of South Asia and {{sud-ouest}}
It is difficult for us to seek to try to get poverty first and to encourage autonomy when, at the same time, it is pursuing trade and political objectives that do not always allow us to tackle poverty directly and which promotes external {{extérieure.}}
While the general {{général}} takes care to recognise the government the right to set itself as good as it seems to be the objectives of the aid programme, it is clear that, following the diversity and diversity of the objectives, {{peut}} can have difficulty in planning and carrying out its programmes with the efficiency of the {{voulue.}}
A number of witnesses have expressed reservations about the {{l'ACDI}} industrial cooperation programme {{Inc.).}} {{Inc.).}}
The stated objective of the programme is to promote the expansion of the private sector in developing countries through cooperation with the private sector.
The {{devant}} before the committee have made the fear that the programme does not make any more than the promotion of export exports.
In view of these comments, the Committee is convinced that the aid programme does not aim to promote the trade in Canada.
The Committee recommends the transfer of any {{l'ACDI}} function which is based primarily on the promotion of trade in bodies which are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the External Trade Trade {{pour}} the {{pour}} for exports.
While making a distinction between aid and trade, the committee believes that {{doit}} must aim for complementarity between the two when this framework with the priorities of the programme already mentioned.
We must also recognise the importance of facilitating exports from developing countries to Canada.
Secondly, we must recognise that certain measures to promote trade in developing countries can exert a positive influence on development.
It would be appropriate for the private sector to promote the private sector in {{(que}} {{nous}} we recommend that trade relations with Canada.
Finally, the related question of {{liée}} aid is the obligation to carry out part of the purchases in the country of {{dont}} whose witnesses has often been mentioned.
There are two aspects to the question.
On the one hand, everything indicates that the aid of {{entre}} between 10 and 15 {{100}} 100 of the value of aid to the beneficiary countries, is creating dependence on abroad, and that it gives rise to waste by making purchases too expensive in the countries of the outside countries.
On the other hand, the aid programme promotes relations and understanding between the peoples and countries, and the aid of the people and the countries will be {{certainement.}}
In addition, if Canada were to be completely {{complètement}} without the other donors it would probably benefit companies and experts from other rich countries, what the {{n'accepteraient}} do not {{c'est}} it is the least that we can say.
In the circumstances, there is a compromise.
The Committee is convinced that there is a means of {{davantage}} more aid, especially in the case of the least developed countries.
Therefore, in the OECD, Canada should call for the gradual elimination of aid from all countries.
The committee states that it is not in the mandate of the {{de}} to promote Canadian exports even if there are circumstances where the aid and trade objectives are complementary.
It recommends that more aid should be made with other donors.
More specifically, the government should work within the OECD Development Committee in order to reduce the percentage of aid linked to 20 {{100}} 100 by the year 2000.
Fourthly, {{l'aide}} {{l'aide}}
The Canadian aid programme operates in more countries than the average among the OECD Member States.
{{sont}} are financed in some {{pays,}} countries, although 70 {{100}} 100 of bilateral aid and about 65 {{100}} 100 of {{l'ACDI}} staff on the ground are concentrated in 28 of them.
Some witnesses have been asked whether Canada should continue to grant small amounts of money as many countries.
The Committee shares this opinion and believes that {{doit}} needs to be better identified to identify its {{comparatifs,}} advantages and to seek excellence in a smaller number of areas of intervention.
By choosing its concentration countries, {{devrait}} should be {{d'abord}} first and foremost, with the aim of helping the most {{démunies.}} populations.
According to the Agency's figures, Canada {{en}} almost 41 {{100}} 100 of its total {{totale}} to the least developed countries, about twice more than the OECD average.
However, the share of aid for the developing countries has increased for ten years.
The geographical distribution of {{se}} aid is mainly in the context of Africa, which is currently receiving the greatest share of bilateral {{bilatérale}} {{p.}} {{100).}} {{100).}}
Some are asked whether the situation is without hope, if Canada would not make a better contribution to its aid elsewhere, where it would do more.
It is true that the increase in ethnic conflict and others has often exacerbated a situation that is already {{pénible.}}
However, we will have another Africa - a change of change and transition.
The efforts that have been made to resolve conflicts in Ethiopia in Mozambique and the Middle East have had a success.
{{d'une}} a {{en}} democracy in South Africa has an extraordinary significance for Africa.
While more and more countries in Africa are moving from an economy in a market economy and open up their political systems to greater participation, it is no longer possible to doubt that a transitional period has been opened.
In relation to Africa, Asia is becoming one of the economic centres of the 21st century and perhaps there would be good reasons for reducing the share of the aid that Canada {{achemine.}}
The {{se}} are finally {{enfin,}} by companies that have a huge divide between rich and poor.
Perhaps they offer the best opportunity to emphasise in the recast of policies on poverty reduction.
In addition, regional integration and the possible enlargement of {{confèrent}} give Canada new responsibilities in this region.
The Committee believes that the support of Canada continues to be too {{et}} and it recommends that more public development aid should be concentrated in less countries, taking into account the primary objective of the {{l'APD.}}
Canada should maintain its current high level of {{allouée}} allocated to Africa, review the share of other regions, and work closely with other donors to ensure better coordination and complementarity of international aid as a whole.
{{partenaires}} partners and the growing needs we are now looking towards Central Europe and Eastern Europe and to the former Soviet Union, where development goes hand in hand with security as we {{au}} in 2.
Unless the transition to democracy is accompanied by an improvement in living conditions, even slow and {{les}} the risks of instability and the {{de}} of {{envers}} to the West cannot be {{écartés.}}
Overall, witnesses have been expressed on the need to extend the range of foreign policy instruments put in place to promote peace and stability in this part of the world.
Aid has been identified as an important element in promoting democratic reforms, preventing conflicts, ensuring transition to market economies and promote trade relations with Canada.
A number of countries have been declared that {{a-t-on}} has been {{à}} and several others will become in the coming years.
Cooperation with Canada is progressing in progress.
We have been able to put forward promising interventions around democratic reforms, {{des}} investment transfers and the growing cooperation between the institutions.
The Committee welcomes the initiative of the {{à}} Government in {{une}} a conference of {{sur}} on partnership to promote the economic transformation of Ukraine.
The witnesses were shared between Russia and Ukraine as a concentration country, but strong arguments were put forward in favour of the latter, given its special links with Canada.
The committee recommends that Canada will continue to carry out active programmes of aid to the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Europe and those of the former Soviet Union.
In addition, it recommends that the funding of these programmes will not {{les}} the priorities of the {{énoncées}} {{plus}}
The development agencies are also {{également,}} that the proliferation of conflicts will lead to the perverse {{pervers}} of aid.
In 1988 in 1992, the share of full aid for emergency aid has {{triplé.}}
In Canada, it has now reached 90 million or 3 {{100}} 100 of total {{totale,}} and it continues to increase.
For example, {{le}} the case of Rwanda where the government, having reached a million dollars of aid in April, has continued over the next few months to increase the money promised at the end of 36 million dollars.
Let us also remember that the disasters for which Canada sent aid last year, 25 were of human origin, {{genres),}} of all {{et}} and six {{étaient}} of natural origin.
In view of the proliferation of internal conflicts throughout the world, several witnesses recommended that the Canadian aid programme addresses the root causes of conflicts and that it is financing various conflict prevention programmes and restoring peace.
The committee accepts the diagnosis, but is not entirely agreed with the {{remède.}}
{{devrait}} should effectively address the root causes of conflicts.
However, it is not realistic to claim to be able to eliminate all conflicts.
When it comes to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems to us to be in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the National Defence {{de}} working in close cooperation and try to restore peace.
In view of what seems to be a constant increase in conflicts, the committee recommends that Canada continues to respond to emergency {{d'urgence,}} but it sets out {{de}} criteria so that long-term development aid remains the primary task of the aid programme.
The fifth measure - to improve the results throughout the {{des}} of witnesses have said that the best way for the committee to increase the effectiveness of the aid programme would be to clarify the mandate of {{l'ACDI}}
However, we should also act on other plans, starting with relations between {{et}} and its partners.
The partnership {{de}} which will support aid initiatives from civil society {{comptent}} are in favour of around 13 {{100}} 100 of the {{l'ACDI.}} budget.
It is estimated that around 500 NGOs, 2 000 companies and 125 schools and universities are {{entre}} among other things, 30 {{10}} the Federal {{et}} and {{et}} and 20 {{participent}} associations are directly involved in the achievement of Canada programmes on the ground.
{{la}} the diversity of partners is one of the strong points of the aid programme, perhaps we have reached a {{décroissants.}}
We believe that there is perhaps too much partnership.
In this respect, there have been little performance assessments in the {{ce}} which is curious given what we know about the {{que}} results that international aid has achieved as a whole.
{{Canada}} Canada was one of the only organisations to criticise its NGOs.
In its {{CARE}} {{laisse}} suggests that the {{des}} of NGOs should be {{sensiblement»}}
According to the {{le}} the problem is {{en}} partly to the complex complexity of the financing mechanisms of {{:}} despite its diversity, the system has little {{ou}} or {{d'innovation.}}
It {{une}} a relationship which has clearly taken the border between the valuable elements of diversity and {{et,}} and the destructive effects of fragmentation and {{dispersion.}}
In addition to the {{le}} the committee has looked at the financing programmes.
In the field of {{exigées}} required by its partners, the policy of {{n'est}} is not uniform and it often accepts funding in a ratio of nine and even more.
The committee recommends to maintain and even {{la}} the share of the funds allocated to partnership programmes, or the partners have shown their effectiveness and their {{efficience.}}
{{doit}} must also take into account the support of its partners in Canada and which is reflected in the commitment of volunteers working for the organisation in question and the ability to collect additional contributions to those of {{l'ACDI.}}
{{aux}} multilateral organisations is a fundamental aspect of the development aid programme of Canada and its foreign policy.
The multilateral organisations will now take greater importance because more and more decisions are taken at international level.
These organisations can also take action that are not the scope of a bilateral programme, especially in times of reducing resources.
Their efficiency is {{toutefois.}}
The multilateral organisations receive around 25 {{100}} 100 {{l'APD}} {{et}} and there is a rich {{de}} of {{et}} and {{fonctions.}}
Six organisations - large UN agencies and the {{développement)}} banks, share 83 {{100}} 100 of multilateral aid, and 48 other organisations share the same concentration of the same concentration as the bilateral aid of bilateral aid.
The multilateral organisations play a vital role in {{témoignages,}} and Canada should reaffirm its strong traditional support.
However, the Committee has received little details about their performance.
However, we know that a review of the World Bank has come to the conclusion several years ago that a large proportion of its projects had been {{désirer.}}
{{Nord-Sud,}} {{qui}} who has given us the most thought of the {{a}} has criticised some of their practices and called for reforms of reform.
However, it was agreed that multilateral organisations would be more important in the future and that Canada should give them strong support.
{{a}} has increased the bureaucratic measures to ensure sound management of public money, but we do not know whether they have improved the results on the ground.
We are convinced that in the context of a thorough parliamentary examination of the so-called {{--}} measure - {{«Première}} {{--}} - {{le}} the {{se}} to look at the question of the effectiveness of aid.
The {{seraient}} would be much more {{par}} by the efforts of the renewal and {{du}} of the mandate of {{s'ils}} if they were to have an equivalent concern to ensure that public funds are spent as effectively as possible.
We need to review all the financing mechanisms and the provision of aid according to the development of circumstances.
It is worth knowing whether a programme that goes fully on donations is still appropriate when the beneficiary countries can {{rembourser.}}
We should look at the options that would make it possible to make a better effect with the meagre aid resources.
The food aid should also be reviewed.
The government must continue to monitor these programmes in order to ensure that they meet emergency situations and serve to promote food safety.
Food aid must not create a state of dependence or discourage local production.
The {{mesure}} measure has changed.
The desire for Canada to tackle global poverty is in the context of a national debt crisis in the context of a national debt crisis.
There are many witnesses and not just the {{nous}} we have said that in order to contribute to creating a better world of Canada must first place its own business.
This will require rigorous limitation of the funds earmarked for development aid, such as other {{gouvernementaux.}} programmes.
On the other hand, other donors fear that the constant reduction in Canadian budgets {{ne}} does not {{l'ACDI}} the resources needed to achieve an integrated and effective programme.
In these circumstances, the Committee stresses a great deal in these circumstances, so that the mandate and priorities of the aid programme are {{le}} it is essential that the {{concentre,}} {{de}} in the most effective way of its limited resources.
The Committee also believes that the time has also come for Canada, to be open and honest on its prospects for achieving its international aid objectives.
The commitment of {{p.}} {{100}} 100 of GNP will not be achieved, given the current tax situation.
The {{l'APD}} ratio of GNP is currently around {{p.}} {{(ce}} 100 - which puts Canada to the seventh one of the donor countries of the {{mais}} but it will quickly be and {{s'approche}} by the average {{p.}} {{100}} 100 of the OECD countries.
On the other hand, it is important to ensure that there is a certain financial stability so that it can plan for the future and on the basis of the changes we recommend in its mandate.
The committee recommends that the government is committed to stabilising the {{l'APD}} ratio of GNP at its current level, and that it is trying to make it {{à}} 100 when the financial situation of Canada {{permettra.}}
As the expansion of trade is more important than the aid for many developing countries, the committee also recommends that the government is planning to open up the Canadian market to developing countries, particularly to the least developed countries.
{{--}} - {{du}}
The Committee believes that these six concrete measures can make a significant contribution to restoring vitality to the Agency for International Development and which is based on the aid programme for Canada, and will help to regain its {{vocation.}}
But one final element is needed.
We have been hit by the differences of opinion that some of the issues of development, and by concluding that we need more understanding and dialogue around our aid programme.
We could start with greater transparency, particularly with regard to Parliament.
In addition, in order to reconcile the various interests at stake in development aid, periodic consultations with representatives of the private sector, NGOs, universities and other important groups could be established.
They would not only be on international aid, but also on issues of greater scope such as safety and sustainable development.
In this way, a link could be established with the wider mechanisms of consultation on foreign policy.
As a result, the committee recommends broader consultations on development cooperation, to which Members will be involved.
We are {{ce}} this chapter on a realistic note.
Full development aid in the world is only a small fraction of global trade and financial trade.
It is only a small part of the resources that the countries of the third world devote to their own development.
It is clear that development aid will not help to improve the fate of two-thirds of the day overnight.
Its role to quote Richard {{de}} de {{est}} is to serve as a source of {{compensateur}} of power and a bridge between countries and peoples.
The time has come for the international community to use its limited resources with greater conscience than in the past, with the aim of the objective and priorities.

However, the answer is quite simple: these achievements have given the public interest throughout the world.
In so doing, they have contributed to creating a {{du}} image of Canada, to give an idea of what we represent as a society and even of what we are {{produisons.}}
Never has a parliamentary committee to look at the foreign policy of Canada had heard so many witnesses to a message as simple as {{Jamais}}
The foreign policy of Canada must celebrate and promote cultural culture and knowledge as a privileged way of promoting our interests in international affairs.
The witnesses has told us that it is perhaps the work of these {{bien}} much more than the commitment of Canada to development aid and to maintain peace with the United Nations, which defines the image of Canada abroad.
{{la}} the extent that foreign policy is based on recognition by a foreign public, the {{de}} of our culture is essential to our foreign policy.
What is more, we are dependent more on this cultural image than the handful of allies and competitors which, more than we are {{leur}} their image by other {{moyens.»}}
In our opinion, the words of John {{Saul}} {{décrivent}} describe a fundamental truth that has not yet been recognised by its value.
In order to {{Griffiths,}} {{politicologue}} {{à}} at the University of {{la}} culture has another {{:}}
{{la}} culture and security are not set together, but {{il}} it is high time to think about these links because the world is {{évolue.}}
The new {{de}} of foreign policy must give cultural considerations a much greater place than we have in the last few years.
It stresses that the promotion of our civilisation abroad goes hand in hand with the promotion of a cultural and {{vigoureuse}} life in Canada, because the force of this cultural and cultural life is essential to the ability to choose {{:}}

I believe that they are already threatened today even in our country.
We believe that Mr {{a}} has made another fundamental point.
As the Association of {{et}} {{de}} has pointed out, {{Québec}}
Cultural goods are not, like other types of goods, goods.
This is one of their {{:}} {{prédominantes}} they have a language, nationality, a {{socio-culturel}} {{un}} a specific {{spécifique,}} a {{qui}} a {{qui}} which affects their {{leur}} their reception and international trade.
science, education and political policy
{{et}} culture and {{canadiens}} beyond our borders must therefore be seen as a fundamental dimension of our foreign policy.
The promotion of Canadian values and interests depends on how Canada is perceived abroad.
The more its image will be strong, more Canada will be able to be effective and autonomous in its relations with other countries.
Yet the people of {{ne}} do not yet recognise this truth and do not {{pas.}}
A recent study of {{Chartrand}} {{(The}} {{Business}} Business Act {{Affairs)}} shows that in 1990 Canada devoted EUR {{millions}} million to international cultural affairs, according to a broad definition of culture which includes {{les}} science and higher education.
The same year, France had invested 1 {{millions}} million in the same chapter as 18 times more than Canada.
Germany {{1}} 1 {{millions,}} million, Japan 1 {{millions}} million and the United Kingdom {{millions}} million dollars.
The per capita figures are the following {{:}} France {{$,}} {{Allemagne}} Germany {{$,}} {{Royaume-Uni}} {{13,40}} {{13,40}} {{12,60}} {{12,60}} Japan and Canada {{$}} {{seulement.}}
It was not an exceptional year, the figures mentioned are therefore reflected in the importance of these five governments to the {{de}} of their culture abroad, as defined in the broadest sense.
These figures raise a key question.
Why is all these countries, with the exception of Canada, {{tant}} so much money to cultural activities.
{{dans}} in his trial prepared for {{propose}} proposes an {{:}}
There are three main reasons for the developed countries to give such importance to culture and education.
{{Les}} countries are largely in line with the image they {{à}} abroad.
This image affects their room for manoeuvre and influence in the global world.
Cultural exports can be extremely {{rentables.}}
In the United States, for example, they come to the second part of export products.
The penetration of foreign markets depends to a great extent on this {{image.}}
Quite frankly, US films are {{l'Amérique.}}
They sell alcoholic drinks {{vêtements,}} cars and tourism.
They are also selling the {{américain.}}
Countries that do not do everything they can to export their culture are naive and {{s'autodétruisent.}}
They are trying to operate without public image in an international climate where these images play an important role.
As Mr {{«la}} points out, the question is not whether we can afford to spend in order to stimulate our cultural exports, but to know whether we can afford to do so.
We have repeatedly highlighted the importance of culture and higher education in foreign affairs.
According to {{Leduc,}} {{vice-présidente}} Vice-President of {{et}} and research at the University of {{«une}} {{politique}} a foreign policy must include cultural and scientific relations as well as economic and economic relations.
According to the {{Wright,}} {{ancien}} former President of the University of {{la}} foreign policy must give a {{un}}
The increased increase in human resources, {{à}} capital to culture, all the demonstrations of human {{humaines,}} essential factors of the expression of the interests of Canada abroad and its {{(10:25)}} {{(10:25)}}
Thomas {{président}} President of the {{Royal}} {{College}} {{College}} in {{estime}} believes that 'the foreign policy is in the {{liée}} of education and {{(10:17)}}
In the new economy, {{supérieure}} and culture should play a central role in the conduct of the foreign affairs of {{(10:18)}} {{(10:18)}}
The {{des}} of {{danse}} {{de}} {{que}} says that {{:}}
If we consider that the government of Canada must adopt an international policy that includes an initial cultural and cultural aspect is that we firmly believe that it will be in the best interests of Canada.
Because not only is the policy promoting peaceful coexistence between the peoples and a better understanding between cultures.
But it would also encourage development and stabilisation of a dynamic and recognised sector in the {{internationale.»}}
There is another element which explains why we believe that culture and knowledge have their place in foreign policy, their links with prosperity.
If Canada strengthens its identity and {{son}} its innovative and {{créateur,}} spirit will be better placed to deal with international competition.
It is now generally accepted that the new economic reality will be more than any other previous reality, on the knowledge of all {{surtout}} especially scientific and technological knowledge.
As the latest {{sur}} on economic growth, it is the new knowledge that is essential because they are the source of innovations of all gender - {{organisationnelles,}} {{organisationnelles,}} managers and others.
In turn, these innovations can increase the productivity of labour and capital, which has the promise of a higher standard of living not only for {{mais}} but for the people of the world.
When we look at the transmission of old knowledge and the production of new knowledge, it is important not to establish a {{trop}} {{marquée}} between exploitation and sale of natural resources, which our country has always been {{et}} and the functioning of financial data systems.
The knowledge can allow new methods of {{non}} not only for the extraction of natural resources, but also for their distribution at global level.
So let us look at the importance and even the central nature of knowledge, especially once again, as a driving force for the economic prosperity and well-being of the {{Canadiens.}}
This is all the more true because external trade is central to our economic well-being.
The transmission and enlargement of knowledge is not exclusively in schools, {{et}} and universities.
The governments, {{fondations}} foundations and other areas of research also contribute to this.
However, education institutions play a basic role in increasing human capital.
As David {{président}} President of the University of {{:}} {{David}}
According to this analysis, it seems that we are far more than EUR 2 billion per year to the gross domestic product of {{ce}} which is an important proportion of its activities.
How can this be {{fait-il?}}
It is a great deal to do with our activities of {{qui}} which are in many ways in our modern world, among the main employment activities.
I have also made a speech on the creation of jobs by means of {{recherche-développement.}}
higher education institutions also have an important international role to play.
Canada has a number of high-level members and universities who already receive thousands of foreign students.
{{les}} researchers and Canadian students are helping to create a context in which foreign students learn to know Canada, its people and culture.
When it comes to their countries, these students will know our own.
As a result, universities and {{canadiens,}} who are financed from different degrees by public funds, have a duty to ensure that foreign students {{chez}} their home with a favourable image of Canada.
It is also desirable that, as a country, we are making the foreign students the most {{possible.}}
{{comme}} measures such as their exclusion of medical insurance could ultimately affect the interests of Canada.
We should encourage even more foreign students to study in our {{et}} and universities.
We will see more than good will.
Each of these students buy around 15 000 {{de}} of products and services per year, and an increasing number of graduates at the level of control and {{viennent}} come to the country with their families.
{{sont}} exports are very much in favour of Canada, which is more than 60 000 foreign students in its {{instituts}} institutes and universities against 20 000 {{inscrits}} registered in educational institutions abroad.
In fact, the creation and dissemination of knowledge also has an international dimension.
As Robert {{président}} President of the University of {{l'a}} said before the {{la}} the most important university of Canada has concluded {{ententes}} agreements with more than 50 different countries.
Our teaching body is almost 6 000 people in the world of research and {{d'érudition.}}
We would like to draw students around almost all countries.
This year, more than 5 000 foreign students are in front of us, - more than 25 000 of our graduates live abroad.
They often occupy important posts in the {{académique,}} political, economic and cultural spheres of their {{pays.»}}
The {{Fox,}} {{président}} President of the Canadian Education Office insists on the economic dimension of the {{:}}
Education is synonymous with trade.
Trade in education accounts for 1.5 billion dollars for Canada.
This is only foreign students in Canada.
We will have more than EUR 1 billion per year in foreign currency selling the competence, education and Canadian training abroad.
This gives 2.5 billion dollars at all.
In fact, education takes place immediately after wheat in our exports.
Yet this is not recognised and we have not even started to achieve our commercial potential.
In the memory that she presented to the {{l'Association}} Association of {{et}} and {{du}} {{qu'en}} shows that in 1993, 72 {{100}} of its members will have an international role in their {{de}} in relation to the {{p.}} rate of 100 in 1991.
{{développent}} and Canadian {{canadiens}} develop human potential, are a forum to know that the ideas and values of Canadian and create partnerships and alliances are creating partnerships.
In addition, they are {{la}} the competitiveness of {{canadienne.}}
These results are a large part of the {{d'étudiants}} of students and foreign {{étrangers}} in Canada than students and Canadian {{canadiens}} in other countries.
It is rare for scientific research to be restricted within the geographical borders of a country.
The success depends on more and more international scientific networks, and Canada is not as active as it might be in this respect according to {{témoins.}}
On the subject of the {{des}} discussions of the {{l'ALÉNA}} countries on higher education and research, {{Wright,}} {{affirme}} {{que}}
The {{a}} Government has been very much supported the initiatives taken in that country.
The US Government is equally {{généreux.}}
Unfortunately, it is not possible to say so much of Canada and that is a cause for some {{embarras.»}}
The members of the Committee were hit by the strong consensus that has been reached from the higher education community on the need for the {{de}} foreign policy to take account of the strategic importance of the globalisation of higher education in Canada.
The witnesses has made it clear that in order to ensure the competitiveness of Canada on the international stage, the best elements of the next generation must acquire knowledge and skills to deal with other cultures and develop in foreign {{étrangers.}}
In order to do this, Canada should support programmes promoting international mobility of students so that they develop experience abroad.
Moreover, it should support the mobility of teachers, for two reasons.
For {{les}} higher education programmes and thus allow students to remain in the country of {{eux}} also in the middle of the world environment.
And to promote contacts with international research networks, essential contacts for research in Canada.
These contacts must also be supported in order to promote the political and economic objectives of the European foreign policy.
A coherent strategy on these three three {{fronts}}
{{des}} students, mobility of teachers and promotion of {{devrait}} scientific relations should make it possible to achieve essential national objectives, including greater mobility within our own country and improving the quality of our higher education.
The strengthening of international cultural affairs is therefore the new economic objective to develop human resources.
For all these reasons, the committee strongly recommends that international cultural affairs, scientific and international matters be treated as a fundamental dimension of the foreign policy of Canada.
The committee also recommends that the foreign policy of Canada affects cultural affairs, scientific and {{vise}}
Let us say the cultural sovereignty of the {{Canada;}}
help Canada become an important {{important}} in the global economy {{sur}}
contribute to the vitality of the arts and educational {{supérieur;}}
Promoting the export of cultural and cultural products {{Canada;}}
To facilitate knowledge.
In view of the fact that foreign policy is part of the federal competence, the culture and science are areas of competence shared with the provinces and that education is the responsibility of the {{provinces,}}
The committee encourages the government to call on the {{de}} provinces to work together to implement the cultural, scientific and {{éducationnel}} dimension of foreign policy by effective use of mechanisms such as the Advisory Advisory Committee on international activities of education.
A large number of Canadian students look abroad.
Of course, the largest majority of them are going to the United States, and a minority study in England and France.
{{sont}} are those who travel to other European universities and few more than those who are part of Latin America and Asia.
It is not a question of questioning the {{qu'exerce}} of the high quality of education in American universities and the French and French universities on {{canadiens,}} students but we believe that higher education institutions other countries have a lot to offer.
It would therefore be desirable for Canadian students and the Canadian students to change their normal {{habituelles}} and to make short {{--}} - six months a year and even more - in higher education institutions outside the United States, England and France.
The committee recommends that the Government of Canada is seriously considering the possibility of creating {{et}} and {{mettant}} programmes which make the private sector a significant contribution so that Canadian students can make {{mais}} but significant and significant education centres in higher education centres abroad outside the United States and the European countries {{et}} and the students of these other countries can do the same to Canada.
It would be useful for those responsible for these programmes to be informed of what their old students are {{leurs}}
The committee would like to encourage universities and Canadian {{canadiens}} who receive a sufficiently large number of foreign students to follow a common practice, in other countries, to maintain relations with these students when they go home.
That is what they {{régulièrement,}}
encouraging them to form groups of old people in their own countries.
We have to find new ways of keeping contact with the {{contact.}}
{{devraient}} embassies should be involved in an effort that is {{coopératif.}}
The challenges facing us
John {{Saul}} says that the cultural product is {{quatre}}
The creation of production as the publication or production of a {{la}} distribution and consumption.
In Canada, the creation is particularly strong and {{grâce}} thanks to the initiatives of all {{et}} and {{Canadiennes.}}
The creativity of artists, scientists, and {{Canadiens}} {{est}} is well known and has been marked by remarkable impetus in recent decades.
This growth has been {{par}} by the renewal of indigenous cultures and by the contribution of crops to a little across the world.
Through the country, the {{des}} explosion in the cultural activities of local communities has been very {{remarquable.}}
It is at the stage of production that the problems {{surgissent.}}
In order to disseminate its {{sa}} its culture and knowledge must first of all be {{mais}} but also the {{distribuer.}}
Of course, we can always count on a number of autonomous and independent efforts.
But history has shown - and Adam Smith also said - that the market does not achieve cultural products in the quantities of {{voulues.}}
Indeed, the private industry often does not commit itself to the truly innovative companies of fear that they do not return to its costs.
It would therefore be desirable for governments to support production and distribution of {{canadiennes.}}
If we want to ensure the development of {{il}} culture, some difficult international problems will have to be resolved with the production and distribution of cultural products.
The cultures of the whole world are also the profound repercussions of globalisation.
Of course, artists - {{peintres}} {{et}} and {{par}} for example, - have always worked in a global context and assessed their work in relation to the standards of {{mondiales;}}
The first to recognise the phenomenon of globalisation and to carry out the analysis were the students of culture, including the {{McLuhan,}} {{McLuhan,}} {{du}} is one of the most important and best {{connus.}}
As we have said before, globalisation is very well {{très}} with the interests of the {{transnationales.}} companies.
This is also true for the world of culture.
Recently, we have witnessed the creation of large transnational companies integrated {{et}} and {{qui}} which {{les}} production and distribution networks.
These integrated companies are promoting the promotion of certain forms of culture and others.
What is worrying is that in the development of transnational transnational companies is a strong concentration of power between the hands of a small number of people who {{de}} this power to dictate what can be seen and heard consumers.
Just as in other sectors of activity, the globalisation of culture is a fact.
However, if we really want to preserve our {{notre}} our knowledge and culture, we must encourage them to support and protect them from the worst effects of globalisation.
A truly living culture is indeed the only possible way to resist the {{de}} effect of cultural globalisation and, therefore, represents the best way of strengthening the sense of the community.
It is {{étant}} given the obstacles to the Canadian cultural sectors that the cultural industries of the country have provided employment to almost 600 000 people and sold for almost EUR 15 billion and services in 1992.
The fact that a significant part of this cultural production has been {{n'est}} is not {{remarquable.}}
In some cultural industries where Canada has always been a net importer we have even become {{nets.}}
{{perçoit}} for example, now sees half of its charges on works {{à}} from abroad while at the beginning, this rate was only 10 {{100.}} {{100.}}
Despite these figures and these {{il}} it is still the case that the {{consomment}} use foreign {{étrangers,}} not only by {{mais}} but also because the products of their own culture are often difficult to achieve.
There are a number of reasons why this phenomenon is the most striking issue of the lack of distribution networks.
The internal means of disseminating the use of savings are preventing a much wider production and distribution of Canadian cultural products in the country first and then abroad.
It is for this reason that only a {{p.}} 100 % of the {{Canada}} {{du}} {{du}} {{de}} of Canadian films and only 17 {{100}} 100 of books and publications sold here are {{canadienne.}}
According to some {{le}} the lack of Canadian cultural products on the internal market and our low production comes from what can be called the {{des}} of foreign cultural products on the {{canadien.}} market.
As a {{notons}} note that a film that has made its costs on the internal market can still report even if it is sold for almost nothing in {{l'étranger,.}}
The countries that can only count on small internal markets are almost always disadvantaged in relation to those whose huge internal markets allow the cost of almost all their production.
The fact that we can count on a huge and rich internal market and therefore to recover production costs (and often {{davantage)}} allows the American cultural industries to {{leurs}} their products throughout the world at prices that make it possible to {{sur}} on these markets.
The phenomenon of {{comme}} as is often the result of a large part of this kind of cultural {{culturel,}} is being used by the American cultural industries.
That is why it is essential to give local cultures a chance and equally important to enable the local population to consume domestic cultural products, to regulate in a way or another, the {{national».}} {{national».}} {{national».}}
{{existent}} rules already exist for various cultural industries.
However, the Committee believes that we could do better in this regard.
Of course, we must expect the {{s'opposent}} industries to oppose the rules of national content, especially with regard to the presentation and, therefore, to the consumption of films and emissions of {{après}} after all, they will be deprived of the profits they {{réaliser.}}
The rules are {{néanmoins.}}
The {{qui}} which is entitled to regulate Canadian content in the field of {{se}} shows so much that it gives the impression that {{profiter}} and television companies would fully benefit from the dissemination of foreign cultural products, especially American cultural products, which are available at low low prices.
In the same way, Canada has the largest network of {{au}} in the world, but the requirements of the {{à}} with regard to {{sont}} are still so {{que}} that 96 {{100}} 100 of varieties of varieties and {{présentés}} presented by the English language are foreign origin.
{{timide}} and limited intervention from the government also explains the shortage of Canadian cultural products in Canada and abroad.
It is easy to {{par}} for example, the creation of a large-scale distribution society of {{tant}} {{canadiennes}} in both the country and abroad by a number of {{d'édition}} Canadian and state, and this joint company would be financed jointly by several {{et}} Canadian and state.
{{avec}} with which powerful cultural vehicles have been {{de}} such as {{International}} International and the Council of Ministers of {{du}} Canada to translate Canadian {{canadiens}} to the other official language - is also a sign of the government {{du}}
The two programmes make Canada aware of a wider public.
Finally, we do not have enough resources to stimulate trade in our cultural {{culturels.}} there are simple, such as the presence of {{au}} in ministerial delegations sent abroad to make our products {{nos}}
{{Medina}} {{a}} said that {{commercialisation}} and {{requièrent}} require the promotion of our cultural industries abroad in the same way as the promotion of telecommunications, {{.}} - thanks to the financing of {{(10:23).}} {{(10:23).}}
And {{Fox,}} {{du}} of the Canadian Education Office {{abondait}} {{dans}} in the same direction, {{ce}} what is the subject of trade and the promotion of trade, we should be inspired by what other countries are doing to sell their education {{.}} .
In fact, as a {{nous}} we do not have access to the federal programmes such as {{(Programme}} {{de}} {{des}}
We lack {{(29:31)}} {{(29:31)}}
As far as the final stage is concerned, that is the consumption of domestic cultural products by the population, we are facing a real reality.
We are very much living on the side of many Americans, and the majority of us read and understand the language of American culture.
It is therefore not surprising that many {{consomment}} are using more {{et}} scientific and university products from the United States than Canada.
The penetration of American culture is particularly felt in the {{anglophones}} {{pour}} for which language is not a natural {{naturel.}}
In our opinion, {{ne}} do not seek to escape American culture, but they would like to change the current state of affairs because it has not only negative effects in itself, but it is harmful to the conduct of the country's foreign policy.
All the reports are to conclude that the {{des}} of values and interests of a country in the world depends largely on the image that it intends through cultural and cultural products and it is very important that culture and education should be {{l'intérieur}} within borders.
In other words, the effectiveness of the foreign policy of Canada is directly linked to the quality of the creativity of artists, {{et}} and scientists {{à}} to the effectiveness of production and the dissemination of their works and the consumption of them in the country and abroad.
{{énergiquement}} our culture in order to give us all these {{de}} of our foreign policy.
In the previous paragraphs we have presented some of the elements of a strategy on cultural relations, scientific and scientific relations.
Other considerations have been brought to the attention of the Committee by John {{Saul}} {{dans}} in his test and by the honourable Member {{Joyal}} in his report entitled {{politique}} international cultural policy of the 1990s, the challenges and means of {{relance».}}
These two documents contain proposals taking into account the special circumstances for each of the major cultural industries, namely {{la}} {{les}} sport, sport, television and {{théâtre.}}
On the basis of {{les}} the proposals for the establishment of programmes for the translation, the creation of an agency of {{la}} the publication of a book on {{l'établissement}} the publication of a {{sans}} agency without forgetting the suggestions for educational {{éducatifs.}}
In the field of {{le}} the Committee notes the suggestions on {{compacts}} {{compacts}} and {{audio}} {{que}} and {{les}} {{canadiens.}}
In terms of {{visuels,}} {{le}} the committee points out to the government of ideas on the {{et}} and art of art and {{la}}
As far as sport is concerned, the committee believes that the idea of holding the Arctic Games and the Olympic Games {{mérite}} deserves to be {{étudiée.}}
We have previously referred to the measures that the {{pourrait}} could take.
There are other measures relating to television, in particular the creation of a sale agency and the promotion of Canadian emissions abroad.
As far as the film is concerned, the Committee of the Committee of the Commission has made specific proposals for funding, the {{de}} policy of films in aircraft and promoting {{coproduction.}} {{coproduction.}}
Finally, to promote the {{des}} {{canadien,}} of concrete suggestions have been made towards the {{des}} of trade and the creation of a national school {{théâtre.}}
These proposals should be assessed within the framework of a strategy to implement {{en}} policy on cultural relations, scientific and scientific relations.
The committee recommends that the government of Canada, together with the provinces of the {{intéressées,}} is a priority for the development of a strategy on cultural, scientific and {{éducationnelles}} relations.
This strategy could use regulation and other means, such as joint companies with the private sector, to support the production of Canadian cultural products and their distribution in Canada and abroad.
It should take into account the special circumstances and specific proposals to each of the major cultural industries, namely {{la}} {{les}} sport, sport, television and the {{et}} and concrete proposals contained in John {{Saul}} {{et}} report and the report by Mrs {{Joyal.}} {{Joyal.}}
Once {{la}} the strategy should be {{aux}} to the permanent parliamentary committees responsible for foreign affairs.
As we suggested in the field on trade, the Government of Canada must take advantage of the exemptions made in the framework of {{et}} and {{aux}} to cultural industries in order to adopt regulatory and other measures to protect and promote cultural industries in order to protect and promote cultural industries.
At the forthcoming international negotiations, the government will have to seek alliances to ensure that the need to protect and promote national cultures.
The committee also recommends that the government is trying to promote cultural development in Canada by increasing the support offered to artists, {{et}} and scientists and developing the necessary resources to ensure the distribution of the {{de}} of the latter in Canada and abroad.
In addition, the committee recommends that the Government of Canada should seek cooperation in the {{à}} provinces more {{de}}
In other words, the mobility of students and {{les}} exchanges between institutions and international research and development networks.
{{7:}} {{LE}} {{RÔLE}} {{ET}} {{LA}} {{PLACE}} {{DU}} {{CANADA}} {{CANADA}}
{{l'engagement}} the international commitment of Canada has always {{le}} bilateral {{multilatéral.}}
However, before the Second World War, it is very little.
He had bilateral links in particular with the United Kingdom and the United States in the {{l'Atlantique-Nord»,}} of {{mais}} but he started to have also with France and Japan, while his membership of the British {{britannique}} {{une}} another window on the world.
Canada was also a member of the United Nations {{des}} but rather a supporter of {{l'isolationnisme.}}
The Second World War has changed.
The stronger and safer of itself, Canada has helped to shape the international order of {{et,}} and, when the Cold War {{les}} the United Nations, to organise collective defence of the West.
At that time, the foreign policy of Canada was based on four {{:}} links with Britain and a {{en}} in {{expansion;}}
{{plus}} and {{avec}} relations with the {{l'appartenance}} membership of the United Nations and the participation of NATO.
There have been major changes following the {{:}}
The bilateral links with Great Britain have been {{au}} at the same time as relations with the United States are {{relations}}
Other bilateral relations have developed in particular with France and other members of the European Economic Community {{avec}} with Japan and China.
Canada has {{ses}} relations with the Soviet Union and its allies in the interests of {{détente.}}
It has been used for his membership in the {{et}} and the {{pour}} {{pour}} to work hand in the developing world.
In the meantime, Canada has a leading role in almost all multilateral bodies that were within the UN and outside the UN system to promote international cooperation.
Canada is now facing two categories of challenges that require a new programme of foreign and new policy and diplomatic methods.
In the chapter of bilateral relations, it is the management of important relations with the United States which is the greatest challenge.
In the chapter of multilateral relations, the challenge is to build a international system based on rules and to develop a cooperative approach to global global problems.
On the other hand, the clear distinction between the bilateral approach and the multilateral approach has been {{face}} in the face of the emergence of a new phenomenon, the growing importance of {{et}} and the trend to continental integration.
As this development has major consequences for its foreign policy, Canada must urgently adapt to it.
Relations with the United States
{{sont}} relations are characterised by the fact that the only neighbour of Canada in North America is the only superpower that remains in the world.
As the former Canadian ambassador Richard {{l'a}} said before the Committee {{«Nous}} 'We can speak of our options, but the {{avec}} with the United States is not {{une.»}}
President {{au}} statement in the Canadian Parliament has not lost its {{:}}
{{géographie}} has made us neighbours, history has made us friends, history has made us friends and the need for us has made us {{alliés.»}}
It is a {{complexe}} complex and sometimes difficult relationship.
Both countries have a wide range of customs and {{et}} and countless {{et}} and interests {{rapprochent.}}
Despite the {{des}} of the differences in {{aussi,}} the political philosophy of the {{des}} of ethnic and linguistic {{ethniques}} or attitudes to the law, order and the government.
It is a relationship that affects not only the interests of the foreign policy of Canada, but also all aspects of life in the country.
Canada is largely dependent on the United States on trade and investment, and its vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that its trade surplus with this country helps to finance its heavy external debt.
In defence, Canada is probably more dependent on the United States than any other {{allié.}}
In terms of culture and communications, most of the {{sont}} are constantly and heavily exposed to radio and television emissions, films and {{aux}} to {{et}} and {{américains.}}
It is also a {{qui}} relationship which has a wide range of non-governmental actors and the governments of both sides and at all levels of {{provincial,}} state {{étatique}} and {{municipal).}}
The first {{rencontrent}} ministers regularly meet the governors of the states of various regions, and the Canadian mayors their American American counterparts.
There are many agreements between the provinces and neighbouring states.
{{commerciaux,}} trade trade and trade unions are {{innombrables.}}
In addition, there are more and more agreements for trade cooperation and economic and economic cooperation on both governments and the private sector.
Most of these relations exist independently of the Federal Government, but in many cases it can influence their framework.
The personal {{personnels,}} professional and commercial {{personnels,}} the workings of the bilateral relationship and {{souvent}} often {{les}} the difficulties.
However, they add to the complexity of the relationship and can hinder the problems of the problem.
Given the scale and complexity of the relationship, disputes and {{occasionnels}} {{sont}} are inevitable.
What is important is not that relations are {{au}} in the {{du}} sense of the word, but they are well {{gérées.}}
If the good relations {{une}} an end in itself, Canada would always be {{étant}} as it is the weakest partner called for concessions on behalf of {{l'harmonie.}}
However, if the aim is to manage relations, there are better opportunities for both partners to come up with mutually positive arrangements.
Good management means mutual understanding.
From the point of view of Canada at least, we need to help the Americans better understand Canada and the differences between the two countries.
We also need to make a better effort to understand the political, economic and strategic realities of the United States and the global responsibilities on them.
Good management also requires effective mutual communication.
Over the years, consultations between the two countries have gradually {{élargies.}}
The International Joint Commission {{et}} and the joint defence Commission {{existent}} have long been in existence for a long time.
The interparliamentary group {{créé}} created in {{est}} is more {{récent.}}
More recent is the regular meetings between the two {{d'État}} {{(1982),}} between the Prime Minister and the {{et}} and between other {{Cabinet.}} ministers.
The personal relations in particular at the highest level of the state may be of crucial importance in relations with the US Government, where all appointments to higher posts are carried out by the President.
Unfortunately, the Foreign Ministers have continued to meet {{il}} it should be taken up these {{rencontres.}}
At the same time, we must take into account complications that arise from the creative tension that exist between the executive body and the legislative body provided for by the American Constitution.
This tension was not an important factor in {{pendant}} relations, during the Second World War and until recently, and for two reasons:
Firstly, because the circumstances are {{les}} the powers of the President as {{des}}
And then because Congress {{de}} to deal solely with national affairs, leaving foreign policy to the President.
{{témoins}} have drawn our attention to the fact that, in the last 20 years, the situation has changed for the following reasons.
First of all, the Congress has lost all confidence in the Italian Government.
Secondly, the distinction between foreign policy and domestic policy has become increasingly {{floue;}}
In addition, the Congress is increasingly {{de}} to delegate its power to regulate the trade that it gives to the President of the Constitution because it believes that the executive is too easily {{trop}} American commercial interests when it can obtain benefits in other {{secteurs;}}
Finally, the power to Congress has {{après}} after the abolition of {{sur}} rules on {{l'ancienneté.}}
The presence of a democratic majority in the two {{ne}} no longer guarantees the President that he can adopt a draft law by the {{Congrès.}}
As the Committee on {{Gotlieb,}} {{ancien}} has said, former ambassador in Washington {{«Des}} {{changements}} dramatic changes have taken place in the operation of the American system {{.}} {{.]}}
There is therefore a decentralised power to Congress and the chairmen of the committees and {{qui}} who really have the executive power {{.}} {{.]»}} {{.]»}}
That is {{:}}
Canada, like other countries, can no longer count on the executive to defend its interests with the {{il}} it must deal directly with the {{Congrès.}}
This is what the Government of Canada has done for ten years.
Indeed, the Committee has said that the {{jouit}} staff have freedom of access without equal access to the offices of the Senate and of the House of representatives.
One of the main activities of the Ambassador is now to meet members of Congress when the interests of Canada are put into question.
An effective way of influencing the members of Congress is to train the {{de}} of companies or US industries who feel threatened by protectionist measures advocated by other interests of the United States - which, for example, has been the case when the US {{pâtes}} industry was able to have an increase in its costs if the {{ne}} {{américaine}} industry could no longer enter into {{pays).}}
There must be other ways of dealing with the {{Congrès.}}
Many of us who have been dealing with the members of Congress have been hit by {{des}} communications and contacts between {{législateurs.}}
We need to see a potential asset that can be used for the attention of the Congress of Canadian concerns that have been {{négligées.}}
We believe that the interparliamentary group {{en}} in particular, created by the two legislative {{législatives,}} could be organised much more effectively.
The group provides for meetings for 24 members of each legislative assembly at least once a year or more often in need.
However, in order to exploit the full potential of the {{le}} Parliament must review its selection process so that the {{soit}} delegation is composed of credible Members chosen for their knowledge of the subjects on the agenda.
All the parties represented in the House and the Senate will have to work together to train the best possible.
The Members could also find other ways of entering the members of the {{Congrès.}}
The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs of the two {{pourraient}} could communicate directly with their {{américain.}}
The Canadian {{canadien}} for steel has proved to be an effective means of {{les}} the arguments that the US steel lobby has made in {{Congrès.}}
We accept that additional funds will be required to support these activities, but the benefits of the protection of the interests of Canada and the establishment of support reports with Congress would be {{considérables.}}
The freedom of action of each country is more or less {{dans}} in the world of {{d'aujourd'hui,}} today, but Canada is suffering more than most because of the proximity of the United States and the {{de}} of its relationship with them.
The disparity between the power of the two countries is enormous.
There is also a extreme gap between information and knowledge that everyone on the other.
Therefore, the influence of the United States on Canada has no common measure with the influence of Canada on the United States.
It is more important for Canada to {{ses}} its efforts to maximise its power to negotiate and assert its interests.
{{nous}} have told us that it is no longer necessary to {{la}} the foreign policy of Canada to the constraints imposed by the Cold War, but according to {{Gotlieb,}} {{la}} the new constraints could be a lack of will to ensure that the resources of foreign policy are equal to our ambitions.
The fundamental problem of Canada relations with the United States has been defined first time, when we look at the foreign policy carried out in {{comme}} as is the case with {{de}} in a separate manner, but with the United States.
Experience has shown how difficult it is to achieve and reconcile the two objectives - live in harmony with the United States, while maintaining its {{distinct.}}
It was the aim of {{option»,}} {{un}} a concept of a few years {{tard;}}
It was to develop and strengthen the economy and other aspects of the national life of Canada in order to make it less vulnerable to external factors and to ensure its economic, social and cultural development.
Two other options - {{«première»}} maintain the status quo and the {{accroître}} increase integration with the United States - have been rejected.
In practice, however, it is the status quo that has been maintained, and when this option was deemed {{il}} it was decided in the middle of the 1980s, to negotiate the Free Trade Agreement.
Canada must now adapt to the growing economic integration which is due to {{l'ALÉ.}}
In order to ensure that there is wider production of the {{de}} greater freedom of movement of certain production factors and better access to the American market, as we pointed out in Chapter 3, has not put Canada out of the repeated use of protectionist measures.
In addition, this agreement has not reduced the vulnerability of our economy that has placed such a large number of its {{dans}} in the American {{américain,}} which is suffering from poverty on research and development, which is dependent too much on trade and development, which is dependent too much on the {{et}} trade and does not offer the necessary {{nécessaires}} to develop the markets outside the continent.
In addition, Canada has had to deal with the growing pressure exerted by the large American cultural industries whose {{libre»}} approach between a conflict with the attitude in Canada.
Many witnesses have been said about American influence and dependence on {{canadienne.}}
And yet some have said that few people were prepared to look at reality.
According to John {{«cette}} {{façon}} it is {{canadienne}} to act more than to improve the {{.}} {{.]}} {{périodes}} of false representation in which we are {{à}} to ourselves, followed by long periods of {{puis}} and then passive acceptance of a situation that has been created by false {{déclarations.»}}
Among those who had reservations about the effects of economic integration on the independence of {{peu}} {{ont}} have recommended withdrawal from the Free Trade Agreement.
Some witnesses even suggested that the increase in economic integration would ultimately require an economic union with institutions of institutions.
Other witnesses from the other side of the cultural and academic communities have advocated a more courageous defence of the independence of {{fondée}} based on a culture of {{(voir}} {{(voir}} {{le}}
We believe that such a {{multidimensionnelle}} relationship requires a similar strategy.
The Federal Government is just one of the speakers on the Canadian side and therefore cannot establish only the agenda, but it can give the tone and influence the context.
It can make it clear that he intends to work for Canada in the United States.
It can also strongly defend the independence of {{et}} and demand that the rules of the game be respected and that there is genuine reciprocity, while taking into account the need to resolve the disputes in a constructive way.
Canada has the right to promote its interests and must not voluntarily limit its sovereignty more than the United States is prepared to do so.
As many witnesses have already said, there are aspects of US foreign policy, such as the {{de}} of their contributions to the UN, which are very concerned in Canada.
On the other hand, some unilateral trade measures from the United States are not {{pas,}} in our view, with the rules of fair game which {{Canadiens}} {{s'attendent.}}
Canada must express its {{franchement.}} {{franchement.}}
At the same time, it has to choose forms of communication and channels in line with its {{d'ami}} and {{d'allié.}} role.
In any case, {{doit}} must establish its foreign policy, not according to American policies, but according to an {{de}} analysis of the situation.
Canada must be faithful to itself.
Such a strategy must also contain regional and multilateral elements.
Canada must not only defend the {{des}} of the rules on the power in bilateral relations, but also to strengthen regimes based on rules in regional and multinational {{régionales}}
In this respect, a priority sector is trade and investment, where the urgency of a subsidy code is {{comme}} as we have said in Chapter 3.
The strategy should be {{«multilatéraliser»}} as far as possible in {{canado-américaines}} relations with special {{spéciales}} with countries of the same opinion and supporting multilateral institutions, in the hope of limiting unilateral action.
To this end, Canada should form strategic alliances with key countries in other regions, as we suggest under heading {{«régionalisme».}}
In the last analysis, however, however, the success of this {{dépendra}} strategy will depend on how it is carried out by Canada and the ability of the government to present a vision that can inspire a national sense of {{et}} and persuade all the speakers to join their efforts in a {{«Équipe-Canada».}}
For this to happen, the provinces must be ready to work together, as well as the private sector and cultural and academic communities.
Above all, the Canadian public must recognise that it is the future role of Canada and its very nature in question.
The Committee believes that the management of relations between Canada and the United States must take particular account of three fundamental factors.
The characteristics of both countries and the characteristics they have in {{commun;}}
The disparity between the economic and military powers of {{chacun;}}
The tension inherent between independence and integration which must be resolved in a {{coopérative.}} way.
The committee recommends that {{vise}} policy is aimed at protecting the vital interests of Canada, the conservation of sovereignty and Canadian independence and the maintenance of its capacity to play an active and independent role on the international stage {{les}}
We believe that such a policy is an appropriate allocation of resources for the instruments of its implementation, whether it is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the missions abroad, and other ministries active abroad or Parliament.
Given the importance of the powers of the United States, especially in trade issues relating to the interests of Canada, we need to find effective and direct means to raise the concerns of Canada to the members of Congress and {{Sénat.}}
We believe that the {{Canada-États-Unis}} {{Canada-États-Unis}} group offers the potential for this.
However, Parliament must review its selection process so that the future delegations are set up by parliamentarians chosen for their knowledge of the subjects on the agenda.
The group should also work closely with the permanent {{compétents}} committees and the Foreign Minister.
{{régionalisme}}
The {{phénomène}} phenomenon which followed the Second World War, has a greater impact on the development of international relations.
Some regional {{régionaux,}} such as the Organisation of American States {{l'Organisation}} the Organisation of African Unity {{et}} and the League of Arab states, trained to promote functional cooperation based on common political interests, already exists for some time.
{{comme}} such as the Organisation of {{l'Atlantique-Nord}} {{et}} and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe {{sont}} are products of the Cold War.
The European Union is certainly one of the most ambitious regional {{régionaux}}
The origin of the European Economic Community {{ce}} this {{fut}} was created to promote economic integration for political purposes and security, to put an end to the {{et}} wars and to put Europe more on an equal footing with the United States, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other.
More recently, it has been globalisation which has given the economic integration to the regional or regional level.
The mobility of capital and other production factors has made the traditional concepts of national economies absurd and have convinced the governments that they had more to gain from competition than protection.
The promotion of exports which have replaced the substitution of imports, must be given access to their neighbours.
The {{des}} of South-East Asian nations {{MERCOSUR}} {{en}} in South America and {{en}} in North America are all born from this trend.
In addition, everything would make it possible for economic integration at a continental level in Europe, where the EU is to accept new members, in the {{où}} where new candidates will soon come to the door of {{et}} and perhaps soon in Asia.
Globalisation seems to be accompanied by a trend towards {{continentalisation.}}
Where is Canada {{dans}} in this {{portrait?}}
It was a time when it was considered {{puissance}} regional power without {{région».}}
That is no longer the case.
As a signatory to {{le}} Canada is now part of a {{en}} region, and it should in fact be welcomed with the prospect of being part of a region that includes all the {{Amériques.}}
This possibility raises two important issues: what role should Canada play in this {{hémisphère?}}
What role should it play outside the {{l'hémisphère?}}
On this subject, the committee has learned two major conclusions from its visit to {{:}}
Firstly, that the United States is the dominant power of {{et}} relations and that they are the most important partner in most of the countries of the {{sinon}} if not all, including {{Canada;}}
Then Canada must make the efforts and provide the resources necessary to shape its own future, or then accept that the future of {{façonné}} {{par}} by the United States, will also determine the {{sien.}}
At the same time, it is important to ask whether the view of Canada is {{ou}} or should be restricted to our {{hémisphère.}}
Certainly not.
Canada also has important transatlantic and {{transpacifiques}} interests - in economic and political terms and in terms of security - as well as the global interests that it cannot defend only if it plays an active role in other parts of the world.
It would not be in the interests of Canada to leave to North America or to consider the possibility of a divided world in {{rivaux.}} {{rivaux.}}
Therefore, Canada must try to reconcile its new vocation in this Western {{occidental}} with the one that it has in global terms by {{d'efforts}} efforts to build bridges between the continents.
NATO is already providing a bridge of security above the Atlantic.
We should prepare ourselves for the future of an economic {{économique,}} in the form of a free trade area of the Atlantic Atlantic.
The transatlantic {{transatlantiques}} {{et}} and {{de}} of 1990 indicate that this is a way forward.
The {{(APEC)}} Economic Cooperation Forum provides us with a new economic bridge on the Pacific.
Should we not also add a road to this {{pont-là?}}
In our opinion, these issues should be investigated by the government and be included in the agenda of the {{G-7.}}
Canada has interests in all parts of the world, but the nature of these interests varies from a region to another, and within these regions, as they are not themselves {{homogènes.}}
In Chapter 4, we have examined the particular interests of Canada in the {{circumpolaire.}} region.
The brief comments on other important regions and are necessarily very general in nature.
Since the end of the Second World War, Canada has been the main foundation of Canada relations with Europe.
The Cold War has divided these interests, as has divided Europe {{:}} in Western Europe, Canada has contributed to the {{et}} and defence, while in Eastern Europe it has contributed to dialogue and {{dans}} as the conditions {{permettaient.}}
The end of the Cold War offers the opportunity to unite Europe and integrate the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as well as the former Soviet Union to a collective security system for the whole continent, to which Canada can contribute through NATO and {{(voir}}
Furthermore, these countries need technical assistance and other forms of aid to succeed in the difficult transition to democracy and the market economy.
It is in the interests of Canada to contribute to this effort in {{le}}
The European Union will certainly take the importance of the economic plan, while political integration should remain {{pour}} for some time, as we have said in Chapter 3.
In the new Europe, united Germany will play a central role.
In spite of the possibilities that we have to do with the interests of Canada on trade and investment in Western Europe, in recent years, in spite of the efforts of the government to {{et}} and intensify political and cultural trade in the past few years, the government has made a tendency to {{en}}
The European markets are very open to competition, but the quality of export exports in added value is high, and the exports of high technology products have an enormous {{remarquable.}}
The European Union remains important for Canada not only because of the common roots of our values, history and interests, but also in the context of the United Nations, multilateral economic institutions and the NATO {{de}}
In Brussels, the EU said that it wanted to maintain closer cooperation with our country on issues with common interest.
Overall, witnesses have been said to the Committee that Canada now has a {{avec}} relationship with Europe on trade and investment, with which governments had already established a framework for facilitating links with the private sector.
What is more, Canada shares many of the problems {{les}} the economies of Europe in Europe, namely unemployment, the ageing population, social security, social security, social security, social security and social security.
Some have {{l'affaiblissement}} the weakening of traditional links with Europe in terms of education, cultural or scientific and insisted on the importance of {{et}} and {{renforcer.}}
In this regard, the involvement of Canada in the European Space Agency has been made of the Erasmus project and other research and development projects in Europe.
The {{cadre}} framework of 1976 always offers the structure of cooperation in several areas including industrial policy.
However, a new agreement on scientific and technological cooperation should be concluded in 1995.
There is no doubt that the {{revêt}} region is of greater importance not only for Canada, but also for the whole world, as has been said in the chapters 2 and 3.
It may well become the dominant area in the next century.
{{peut}} can be {{d'avoir}} to have the greatest {{milliards}} {{de}} billion {{les}} and the strongest growth rates.
It was also said to the Committee that 50 {{100}} 100 of world trade would be in Asia by the year 2000 {{14:22}} {{14:39).}} and {{14:39).}}
In recent years, Canada links with Asia in the field of trade and immigration have been very {{notamment}} particularly with Japan, which is now the second largest trading partner in Canada.
However, the trade share of Canada in this region has been reduced recently by {{13:6),}} {{et}} and Canadian exports still depend too much on raw materials and {{partiellement}} products.
Fifty per cent of immigrants receive Canada now come from {{terre}} {{ancestrale}} {{des}} 100 {{100}} 100 {{Canadiens.}}
Canada is interested not only in the economic progress of the region, but also to its political stability and security.
As we mentioned in Chapter 2, these interests should be pursued on the basis of mutual support.
According to the Foreign Minister, Mr {{le}} Canada is determined to play an important role in creating new regional institutions, such as {{qui}} which offers a new framework for growth.
ASEAN and ASEAN which offer a political and economic partnership with the countries of Europe through the ASEAN Regional Forum.
Only recently, it was announced that the {{abriterait}} of Canada {{le}} the {{d'études}} Centre in Canada.
In Latin America, the interests of Canada mainly affect trade and investment, aid and more security.
It is also the case that we should establish greater relations with some of these countries in addition to the future enlargement of the {{l'ALÉNA.}}
The areas of cooperation include {{d'études,}} {{d'études,}} legal standards and administrative and financial management.
A number of witnesses have been said to the Committee that Latin America was a region of the world where Canada was regarded as a {{(Hal}} natural partner, {{et}} {{et}} and that the countries of this region would like to establish closer relations with Canada, as a possible {{possible}} to the links they have already with the United States.
Canada helps to transform {{en}} into a genuine {{et}} institution and to prevent it becoming an institution dominated by the United States.
Some witnesses also pointed out that Latin America was in geographical and cultural terms, closer to Canada than is the {{qu'elle}} region that it was open to {{et}} technology and that the {{y}} {{sur}} on cultural {{culturel,}}
They have also shown us that contacts with the private sector were increasingly {{et}} and that trade and investment between Canada and Mexico had almost doubled in 1987 in 1992.
We have also been informed that the countries of this region were firmly involved in democratisation and economic reform, but there are still serious problems in the areas of education and public health or from poverty, environmental degradation and the unequal distribution of wealth.
In Africa, Canada {{dans}} in the foreseeable future, to focus mainly on development aid, respect for the rights of the person and social justice, as well as the implications of these issues at security level.
However, the precise form of this interest varies greatly from one country to another, according to the progress made in implementing economic and political reforms.
The differences are enormous whether it is South Africa, Rwanda, the {{de}} of North Africa or the {{de}} of Africa.
In the reports that the committee has heard, there are strong opposition between companies participating in international development in Africa and most NGOs, the first emphasis on the importance of development in the private sector and the need to establish structural adjustment programmes.
The latest support that these programmes are {{la}} poverty and that greater attention should be given to Community projects made by NGOs.
Some {{du}} of the fact that Africa could be {{(Campbell,}} {{23:15).}} {{23:15).}}
Finally, the Middle East must not forget the Middle East, even if the reports are just a few words about safety.
Indeed, there are important issues to be done about war, peace or reconciliation of the enemies of yesterday, they are a great interest in many {{Notre}} our country can make a significant contribution to resolving the problems that exist and it already exists.
{{qu'il}} it has the confidence of all the parties in question, Canada plays a major role in the guidelines on the peace process in the Middle East and {{le}} the working group on {{réfugiés.)}}
The government has asked the Committee to recommend regional priorities, but we believe that the criteria that should guide Canadian policies must be based on the functions that are committed to the Canadian interests rather than purely geographical considerations.
These regional priorities are {{de}} but they will be the result of an assessment of interests, values and comparative advantages of Canada.
In all regions, such as this report, the vital interests of Canada are emerging as very clear political objectives.
The strengthening of common security, promoting trade and building common prosperity, contribute to sustainable development, reduce poverty and {{les}} Canadian cultures abroad.
The previous chapters have examined each of these objectives in detail.
In so doing, the report has identified priorities for each region.
In each region, priority must be given to strengthening bilateral cooperation with the main countries, particularly in areas of particular importance for Canada.
The committee recommends the government to base its policies and priorities on interests, values and comparative advantages of Canada.
Canada should {{dans}} in the regions, to establish bilateral partnerships according to the regional importance of a country, its political and cultural ties with Canada and its contributions to achieving our objectives.
{{multilatéralisme}}
The term {{a}} has the sense of politics geared towards the international institutions and international {{internationaux}} which have a broad {{et}} and whose aim is to strengthen cooperation.
The notion is therefore deeply rooted in the traditions of {{et}} diplomacy and will probably be more important in the future.
As we have already said, Canada refuses to be {{en}} in North America, that it is trying to establish the most {{que}} links as possible, and that it will {{la}} the training of {{rivaux.}} {{rivaux.}}
So multilateralism and {{ne}} must not be seen as means of {{l'un}} on the one hand, but rather as complementary solutions to the problem of the fragmentation resulting from the {{régionalisme.}}
The generosity of {{est}} is well known, but Canada cannot do everything and is at the same time.
This is why its foreign policy must promote the {{dirigé»}} {{pour}} to enable it to be strong to the multilateral bodies that meet its {{elle}} it must also double bilateral cooperation with countries that share the philosophy of Canada and which are best placed to make progress on the common {{communes.}}
Two criteria must guide the choice of Canada and harmonisation with its own interests and effectiveness of the multilateral system.
What are the interests of Canada in some multilateral {{importantes?}}
On the one hand, there is the {{et}} and the {{qui}} who {{de}} many bridges between continents and {{et}} and which offer important opportunities for Canada to ensure the {{de}} of its two official languages and its cultural diversity.
The {{a}} has changed much over the years, and the return of South Africa has given it a new {{vitalité.}}
The {{s'est}} has also {{par}} for example, the provinces of the {{et}} and the {{y}} they are present under the {{participants»}} {{aux}} alongside Canada, who are held as {{membre».}} {{membre».}}
On the other hand, the United Nations and its institutions find the United Nations and its institutions.
It is mainly thanks to the fact that Canada can participate in international initiatives aimed at peace, security, economic and social development, the environment, human rights and international law.
The foreign policy of Canada must therefore aim to establish - or rather {{--}} the credibility and effectiveness of the UN in its global {{mondiale.}}
Another target must be the World Trade Organisation {{élément}} central to the development of a trade system based on rules.
The international financial institutions, which play a key role in promoting sustainable development within the framework of financial stability.
Finally, {{le}} the {{ou}} or the Group of the seven most {{il}} countries, it is far from being {{mais}} but its scope is global and it would allow the Member States to coordinate their foreign and economic policies and action in the field of security.
Unfortunately, the current structure of these institutions is not the one in which they would need to support the kind of multilateralism that we {{envisageons.}}
{{faite,}} of course, from the World Trade Organisation, which has not yet been set up, the institutions mentioned in the previous paragraph must be examined and corrected for the changes to the changes that the world has experienced since their {{fondation.}}
Chapter 2 deals with the United Nations Security Council and regional bodies, such as NATO and {{qui}} which work closely with the UN in the area of security.
In Chapter 3, we are dealing with international financial institutions and {{ainsi}} as well as the World Trade Organisation.
The end of this chapter will state the reform of the other UN institutions.
Since the creation of the organisation in 1945, the United Nations has always been able to count on Canada, and respect for the principles set out in the UN Charter is the cornerstone of our foreign policy.
These principles continue to reflect Canadian values and deserve the support of Canada, but we must recognise that the organisation has lost part of its credibility because of administrative and financial difficulties.
What is more, the United Nations is constantly in the financial difficulty of the Union, especially the contributions that have not been paid by some Member States, including Russia and the United States.
The {{qui}} who {{devant}} before the committee clearly want the United Nations to exert a real influence on the world stage and call for a complete reform of {{l'organisation.}}
The time is {{les}} the United Nations to celebrate their 50th anniversary next year and Canada should play an active role, even at the forefront of this reform.
One of the most important contributions to this report is from the Canadian Committee for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
These are some of its main recommendations.
In the field of finance, Canada should demand that the Member States take two years behind the payment of their contribution to the payment of their contributions to Article 19 of the {{Charte).}}
It should also support the appointment of a general UN {{de}} who is {{de}} the General Assembly and the parallel creation of a system of review of internal management under the leadership of the UN Secretary-General, the UN appointed a {{général).}} {{général).}}
As far as international development is concerned, Canada should promote the creation of a Security Council in the UN for sustainable development, a high-level decision-making body which would have all the powers of coordinating coordination on the {{spécialisées.}} institutions.
In the area of the rights of the individual, Canada must call for better coordination between the roles of the secretariat and the specialised institutions of the UN, calling on the Secretary-General to take a high-level working group to recommend a series of measures in this direction.
And call for the rapid establishment of an action programme for the {{pour}} for human rights, which has recently been set up in order to ensure coordination with the {{pour}} for refugees and an effective presence on the ground, where the rights of the person are violated or {{menacés.}}
As regards {{le}} Canada should call for simplification and strengthening its structure, the establishment of objective selection methods for the appointment of the Secretary-General and the main leaders and adoption of policies that guarantee equal opportunities for men and women at all levels.
In the chapter of democratisation, Canada should encourage NGOs to work in the work of the United Nations and see a good look at the proposals on the addition of a parliamentary assembly in the UN.
We believe that these are proposals which deserve an examination of the government of {{canadien.}}
They aim to regulate the United Nations financial situation, to change management practices, to respect the principle of responsibility and to improve the efficiency and efficiency of UN operations.
The only way to achieve this last objective is to ensure better coordination between the United Nations and its institutions which have so far resisted the efforts of the Secretary-General or the General Assembly to do so.
In fact, it will not be possible until the Member States, which are, after all, members of the United Nations and the {{spécialisées,}} institutions, not to harmonise and coordinate the policies of the various institutions.
We are {{cet}} this objective to the Canada.
The Committee confirms the commitment of Canada to an international system based on rules and the extension of international law.
It also confirms the importance of better handling the multilateral institutions, making them more effective, and increase their democratic {{démocratique.}}
The committee therefore recommends the adoption of a strategy of {{dirigé»,}} {{c'est-à-dire,}} that is to say a strategy that gives priority to the institutions that serve the best interests of {{canadiens.}} interests.
This should be combined with the establishment of bilateral relations with the countries of the same opinion that are best placed to advance the common {{communes.}}
In addition to the {{et}} and {{Francophonie,}} the targets of this strategy should include the United Nations {{(ONU),}} {{et}} and its {{spécialisées,}} agencies, the World Trade Organisation {{les}} international financial institutions and the {{des}} {{(G-7).}}
Canada must actively promote the next WTO {{prochaine}}
It must also promote an urgent reform of the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions.
The appropriate permanent committees of Parliament should reassess the accession of Canada to the various multilateral institutions, in order to present recommendations on the future of Canada.
The Committee has concluded that it would be neither desirable nor realistic for Canada to choose between the {{le}} {{et}} and multilateralism.
Instead, we must play on the three {{tableaux.}}
The only way to do that.
It is clear that the aim of the exercise would be to maximise the influence of Canada to enable it to protect its autonomy and interests, to promote regimes based on rules and strengthen the most appropriate international institutions to respond to these objectives.
A combination of strategies, as we recommend in this chapter, seems the best way to achieve our objective.
{{8:}} {{LA}} {{DÉMOCRATISATION}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{ÉTRANGÈRE}} {{ÉTRANGÈRE}}
In the guidelines that the Foreign Minister has tabled in the House at the time of the training of {{le}} the government stated that he wanted to {{démocratisation}} the process of developing foreign policy - thanks to greater involvement of the {{directement}} directly and by means of {{Parlement».}}
The last chapter in the report contains our thoughts on the review process of foreign policy and how to improve the future.
Even before the training of the {{le}} the Foreign Minister wrote to several hundred non-governmental organisations {{entreprises,}} companies, {{et}} and universities who have already received financial support from the International Development Agency {{(ACDI).}}
The Minister has informed them about the project to form the committee and invited them to present their opinions, particularly on international aid.
Following this invitation and the advertising surrounding the training of the committee and the {{que}} which it has held on the other side of the country, we received {{mémoires.}} {{mémoires.}}
The {{indique}} picture indicates that more than half of these {{proviennent}} come from the {{dont}} most of which are international aid.
The {{l'ACDI}} policies and practices have also been the subject of a large number of {{soumis}} submitted by companies and a number of {{universités.}}
The Committee decided to meet all those who, in June 1994, have presented a memory or had indicated that they will {{feraient.}}
In order to do this effectively, we have agreed to hold {{à}} at the level of the country.
In order to maximise our efficiency in the short time {{impartis,}} we have divided into three groups of seven or eight Members and {{sénateurs.}}
The first has been in the East {{John's,}} {{Halifax,}} {{Québec}} {{et}} and {{le}} the second in the West {{Vancouver}} {{et}} and {{et}} and the third in {{et}} and {{(Régina,}} {{Winnipeg}} {{et}} and {{Toronto).}}
This way has proved to be so effective - in a small group, the Members could participate more actively - that once return to {{nous}} we have continued to sit in groups to hear a greater number of {{témoins.}}
In any case, the Committee has held more than 80 meetings in which we heard more than {{organismes}} of the {{ou}} or or {{En}}
Instead of spending 15 or 20 minutes to each {{nous}} we will be {{en}} in general with concerns about the same issues.
This has enabled us to give more time to witnesses and to generate constructive trade between {{témoins.}}
In addition to national {{nationale,}} which we have heard above all in {{leurs}} their local sections have often expressed their reports in the region.
Even though the {{nous}} of {{nous}} we have been {{par}} by the care that most witnesses had given their {{présentation.}}
We have received relatively few {{sur}} on security, trade, and finances.
As the mandate we received was also on these issues, we decided to hold {{à}} {{rondes}} on the subject and on other crucial issues for our {{Ces}} these {{rondes}} {{de}} of four to six experts with different views on the same subject.
There are three hours of three hours, the {{rondes}} {{parvenaient}} so that we can stimulate fruitful debates that we have taken on {{21.}}
In addition to the safety of security, trade, international aid and the various regions of the world, we have organised the development of sustainable development, foreign policy in the north, the {{est,}} {{de}} education and culture, communications and foreign policy.
{{témoignages}} and other documents which we have received cover more than 10 000 pages including the 500 {{mémoires.}}
In order to help members of the Committee to be aware of this {{documentation,}} {{huit}} eight {{ont}} documents have been {{chacun}} each of the main issues of the mandate of the {{Comité.}}
These documents systematically {{de}} the views of witnesses and their recommendations on each issue.
In order to obtain extensive opinions on the major issues, the committee asked for the four following {{suivants}} to draw up {{:}}
John {{Saul}} {{(«La}} {{culture}} culture and {{étrangère»),}} {{Martens}} {{Martens}} {{Martens}} new foreign aid and {{Denis}} {{Stairs}} {{(«Questions}} {{importantes}} {{importantes}} {{importantes}} and {{Alexandroff}} {{Alexandroff}} and Alan {{(«Le}} {{Canada}} and {{Alexandroff}} {{du}}
These documents will be published in a volume of {{à}}
Finally, so that we know how the major challenges of our foreign policy are perceived abroad and to know what we think of Canada, the committee has again divided into three groups to make brief visits to Washington, Brussels and New York.
The programme of each visit was responsible for meetings with representatives of Canada abroad and representatives of large international organisations, {{de}} research, foreign countries and international organisations.
In Brussels, the group was not only held with NATO and European Union {{de}} but also with the head of the {{CSCE,}} secretariat in Vienna, and a High Representative of the OECD in Paris.
In Washington, the group met with representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation of American States.
In New York, the group met the UN representatives and its agencies.
The committee had to deal with the lack of time.
Seven months ago, it is very little to cover all the issues mentioned in the guidelines, especially for a committee which is {{pour}} for the first time.
We have not had the time to deepen many issues as much as we would have liked.
We have not been able to deal with the whole of the issues raised by the hundreds of individuals and groups who have contributed to us.
Given the scale of our mandate and the {{de}} of our {{nous}} we had to limit ourselves to a small number of questions which we would like to pay attention to.
That is why, in various places in the report, we have pointed out issues on which the permanent committees on Foreign Affairs, the Senate or the House of the European Parliament should be {{permanence.}}
We are also proposing that there are other issues which are subject to detailed {{approfondie.}}
We are grateful for the {{et}} analyses and sometimes detailed recommendations that have been given to us on issues that we could not properly {{examiner.}}
We will {{au}} them to the government and Parliament for more {{examen.}}
In order to contribute to this process, we are making public, in order to ensure greater {{les}} the tests that we have {{et}} and the synthesis documents which {{les}} the {{témoignages.}}
In addition to the meetings organised by the {{nous}} we know that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has made a number of consultations, some of which were completed in time for us to take into account.
In particular, we have taken note of the report by the Director for examining the promotion of international trade, chaired by the head of the leadership of the ECB {{L.R.}} {{(Red)}} {{Wilson,}} {{qui}} who was sent to the World Trade Minister.
The members of the Committee were able to participate in the National Forum on International Relations in Canada on 21 and 22 March.
They have found less useful experience that it could have done.
If the government decided to make a mechanism for annual consultation of the {{canadienne,}} population, we believe that it would be more useful if more public participation was {{si}} if the discussion was focused on a limited number of key issues and the organisation of the Forum allowed to discuss the conclusions.
In addition, we suggest that the discussion should be better targeted at making progress to the participants in the relevant documents.
The Committee is also in favour of continuing the dialogue on international relations and to pursue awareness efforts in this area.
In our world {{les}} international relations have an increasing impact on the welfare of {{Canadiens.}}
We should therefore give the last opportunity to realise the complexities of foreign policy and have a word to say in the decisions that are being made.
One of the proposals made in this context is to create a {{d'étude}} study of the {{qui}} policy, which will {{les}} the priority areas of analysis and would contribute to public debate.
One of its functions would probably be to promote the dialogue between the {{gouvernementaux,}} {{gouvernementaux,}} associations and professionals, and non-governmental organisations, and non-governmental organisations, which we believe to be {{activement.}}
In the same way, we believe that representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and {{devraient}} should participate in this dialogue, both in order to make use of the others of their knowledge and to be more {{imputables.}}
In our {{du}} we have been aware of the great volume of research already carried out by universities, research institutes and trade organisations, trade union organisations and collective {{canadiens.}}
Furthermore, it is easy to access the vast research work abroad.
We are convinced that as such research will be known to a greater public, thanks to the intensification of dialogue between the various {{elles}} they will be able to meet the various needs of the {{canadienne.}} population.
That is why we believe that the European Foreign Policy study Centre which we are proposing or an equivalent institution like the Canadian Institute for Peace and International Security {{devrait}} should pay particular attention to the strengthening of links between the various groups of {{Canadiens.}}
Some of our Members have expressed the intention to organise public assemblies on foreign policy issues in their constituency.
We are {{de}} such initiatives, which should help {{à}} to realise how international relations affect their lives.
{{la}} the quality of the environment, the ethnic composition of the country and many other situations that we live in Canada are all directly affected by what is happening abroad and how Canada is {{réagit.}}
Public assemblies would be an effective means of making the message to ordinary citizens.
If the Members wish to take a better view of the {{à}} how international relations are on their daily lives, it is important that they are {{renseignés.}}
The Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Committee on Defence and Defence Policy can contribute to this.
It would perhaps be interesting to try to {{des}} informal consultations that exist in the Scandinavian countries, Germany and France.
The Foreign Ministers of these countries are taking time for meetings behind closed doors with the members of their parliamentary committees in international relations to discuss the problems of the day.
In addition to allowing Members to seize the complexity of international problems, the adoption of this practice in Canada would provide the ministers with a means of consulting the people who are interested in foreign relations.
It would also give the Canadian Members more {{aux}} when they meet their counterparts abroad.
The many {{qui}} who have taken time and have given us the trouble to tell us of their advice, we express our sincere thanks.
This report, which is based on their experience, is the expression of the best judgment that we can make on the major challenges that Canada faces in the area of foreign policy, in these times where, both in the country and abroad, any change so quickly.
What has been particularly affected in the reports of the {{c'est}} is their {{et}} and their deep {{moralité.}}
{{veulent}} want to create a better world.
We hope that these feelings and aspirations will {{le}} the report that we are presenting to Parliament, {{(Ontario)}} {{K1A}} {{0G2}} {{le}} on 7 February February 1995.
The honourable Member {{J.}} {{MacEachen,}} {{C.P.}} {{Jean-Robert}} {{Jean-Robert}} {{Coprésidents}} {{Coprésidents}}
the Special Joint Committee for examining the foreign policy of Canada {{K1A}} {{0A6}} {{0A6}} {{MM.}} {{MM.}} {{MM.}}
{{coprésidents,}}
We are pleased to hear you {{la}} the full response of the government to every recommendation of the report by the Special Joint Committee on the review of the foreign policy of Canada, the report entitled the foreign policy of Canada - principles and priorities for the future.
On behalf of the government, we want to thank you for the production of this substantial and thorough report and for all the work of the Joint Committee.
The government has carefully studied your comments and recommendations and it has taken account of the development of the foreign policy policy which you will also find as well.
The government wishes to work even more closely in the months and years to come to Parliament so that the development of the policy continues to benefit from the public and that the implementation of our foreign policy will be assessed by an assessment assessment.
As you know, the government agrees with the broad guidelines which, according to your report, should guide the foreign policy of Canada.
The government shares your opinion on the very large majority of the recommendations made in the report.
The government shares the opinion of the Committee on the increasing importance of international affairs in the daily life of {{et}} and {{Canadiennes.}}
They show an increasing interest in foreign affairs, either individually or through the government partners, such as {{le}} the private sector, NGOs and other institutions of the institutions.
Your report and the {{reflètent}} of the government reflect the profound values that the {{et}} and the {{veulent}} want to see {{par}} by Canada abroad.
Our population wants a dynamic and independent foreign policy.
Like your report, the government of the government makes it clear that there are major changes in the world and emphasises the challenges facing Canada and the opportunities that have to build a better world.
The government should be selective in its speeches.
For this reason, and in view of the current budgetary restrictions, the government will have to fulfil its foreign policy objectives, {{les}} existing resources.
In the light of these considerations, the government has decided to {{la}} the foreign policy of Canada on the three priority objectives, to promote prosperity and to protect our security, in a {{et}} global framework and to project values and culture.
Let us now take these objectives into detail as in your {{:}}
In the area of security, the government must adopt a broader level of security, so that it includes both military and military factors.
Our common security can, in the long term, be seriously compromised by the development of global trends in many areas - the environment, {{migration,}} migration, ethnic {{ethniques,}} {{développement.}} {{développement.}}
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will create an office for global challenges, which will be a {{afin}} {{adjoint,}} in order to ensure greater coherence between Canadian policies affecting security in its military aspects.
As the White Paper on defence, the maintenance of peace will remain an international mandate for the {{canadiennes,}} armed {{armées}} once they are {{rééquilibrées.}}
Canada will support the reform of the UN and the Security Council - the Committee has made relevant recommendations to this {{et}} and will seek to sit in the Security Council in {{1999-2000.}}
Canada will remain active in the NATO {{l'OTAN}} and the OSCE, and will continue to participate in the security dialogue in Latin America, {{et}} and Africa.
{{décrit}} described more in detail these points.
In the area of trade policy, the government will continue to participate in the construction of a multilateral trade system based on the primacy of the law and not on {{force.}} reports.
The government will also continue negotiations in the dossiers not yet {{à}} following the Uruguay Round.
And as the {{il}} suggests, it will continue appropriate links between trade policy and the rights of the individual, environment and labour standards.
In some cases, these links can be dealt with directly by {{dans}} in other cases, an additional study will be required at the OECD level or other institutions as an {{l'OIT.}}
The government will defend our trade interests in the United States.
As the {{il}} suggests, it will seek to give a multilateral nature to its relations, for example by extending {{et}} and encouraging the continuation of the work to be carried out by a free trade agreement for {{(ALEA).}} {{(ALEA).}}
The government will try to conclude an agreement on the laws on commercial use, by means of {{l'ALENA}} working {{de}} on subsidies and compensation measures and {{l'antidumping.}}
The government will also study the possibility of concluding a free trade agreement {{européenne,}} as the Prime Minister in France has announced in the case of the presentation of the {{Comité,}} report and will support the establishment of free trade in the {{l'Asie-Pacifique}} region by 2020, as recommended by the {{l'APEC.}}
The government will continue to use the {{«Équipe}} Trade Trade {{«Équipe}} which was used in Asia last year and Latin America earlier this year.
At the {{du}} economic summit in {{en}} in June, the government of {{les}} discussions on the reform of the institutions governing the global economy, including the international financial institutions {{et}} and will put pressure on a long-term approach to their development.
In order to increase transparency and {{le}} the government intends to prepare annual reports on the participation of Canada to multilateral development banks following the reports that have already been submitted on the Bretton Woods institutions and on the {{et}} and will provide the parliamentary committees of the figures by ministers and officials.
As regards the promotion of international trade, the government has examined carefully the proposal to establish a joint {{conjoint}}
However, it concluded that the valuable links between the {{et}} Service and the rest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade are very much {{à}} to the creation of a public-private {{public-privé}} which {{autour}} around the {{commerciaux.}} Service.
However, as the {{réformera}} Government {{l'Énoncé,}} in depth its methods of promoting international trade, according to the spirit of the recommendations of the {{Comité.}}
In addition, as the committee suggests, and clearly points out that the government will pay greater attention to the growing markets of {{et}} and {{et}} and will focus its financial efforts on small and medium-sized enterprises.
It will also be an integral part of the government strategy to be better aware of the cultural and educational products of Canada too.
In addition, it {{avec}} with the provinces and the private sector so that the international orientation of companies can be strengthened.
In the areas of the environment and sustainable development, the government will be active in accordance with the commitments made at the {{à}} Summit in {{Rio.}}
In addition to the current international {{internationales}} priorities on high {{mer;}}
International rules on sustainable management of {{forêts;}}
Trade rules for developing development.
Environmental issues in North America whose resolution of cross-border disputes and the implementation of the {{nord-américain}} Cooperation Agreement in the field of the environment
{{des}} climate change has {{des}}
Implementation of the strategy of environmental industries
and implementation of the impact assessment directives
The government will give greater priority to {{et}} cooperation and will seek to reform the international institutions on sustainable development.
The government will also seek to ratify the United Nations III Convention on the Law of the sea as soon as it has examined our laws in order to assess compliance with the provisions of the Convention.
With regard to development aid, the government should be able to make improvements in each of the areas mentioned by the {{Comité.}}
The government has taken concrete steps to clarify the mandate and priorities of the {{Publique}} {{Publique}} programme in {{Développement.}}
In addition, it {{les}} development partnerships will improve the effectiveness of aid and will make it easier to know the results of the people of {{canadienne.}}
The measures that it will take will be aimed at strengthening the mandate, efficiency and {{du}} of the programme.
The government believes that the measures we have put in place to ensure a clear mandate and stable objectives for {{pour}} to increase responsibility and to strengthen the role of Parliament do not require a legislative mandate to guide {{l'APD.}}
On the basis of the three priority objectives of our foreign policy, the government wants {{canadienne}} {{soutienne}} to support sustainable development in developing countries, in order to reduce poverty and make the world safer and more {{prospère.}}
This set of principles will allow the {{de}} programme to play an important role in the challenges we have faced with the new threats to common security, while reaffirming our fundamental commitment to the reduction of poverty, and economic and social justice will clearly link the objectives of the reduction of poverty and economic and social justice.
{{canadienne}} {{se}} will focus on the six key sectors and will include activities at local and institutional levels as well as {{:}}
The basic human needs - the {{consacrée}} devoted to this part will increase in 25% according to the suggestion of the {{Comité);}}
Women and development, services {{d'infrastructures;}}
The rights of {{démocratie}} democracy and {{gouvernement;}}
Development of the sector
and the environment.
The government is committed to progress towards 0.7% of GNP on {{lorsque}} when the financial situation of Canada {{permettra.}}
However, in view of current fiscal {{fiscales}} all government programmes are subject to examination and the {{ne}} programme is no exception.
The government congratulates the Committee on its innovative work on the {{de}} of culture and Canadian knowledge abroad, and it is important for this to be given the importance of this.
The detailed recommendations of the Committee and the studies prepared for it will be valuable points of reference to the approach that the Canadian Government will take with the provinces and other speakers in order to make progress in the interests of Canada in this area.
In this respect, the special position of the {{et}} and {{au}} in the {{est}} is an asset for our foreign policy.
{{et}} and {{ont}} have said to the Committee that they want their governments to work together to make the creative spirit and the Canadian knowledge abroad.
The government is in the same position.
Respect for the rights of the person has been and remains a priority issue for {{et}} and {{Canadiennes.}}
In the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in recent terms, the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been in the vanguard of countries seeking to defend dignity and human freedoms.
The government reaffirms its commitment to the International Centre on Human Rights and democratic development.
This Centre will continue to play a leading role in achieving the {{canadiens.}} objectives.
The government considers respect for the rights of the person not only as a fundamental value, but also as a crucial element for the development of democratic and peaceful societies.
The first question is how can we have the greatest influence on other governments so that they respect the fundamental rights of the {{personnes?}}
Our aim is not to punish the countries and innocent people whose rights are violated by their governments, but rather to change behaviour and encourage governments to respect the rights of their people.
In every situation, our attitude will have to be based on a number of factors and, above all, of the effectiveness of the tools at our disposal to influence events.
Canada efforts to promote the rights of the person take various forms, including dialogue and consultation in multilateral bodies.
Development aid is a constructive way of promoting the rights of the individual, democracy and the good government.
In order to achieve its objectives, Canada will continue to work with its partners, including governments, NGOs and multilateral organisations.
The aid programme will support various activities, for example, the recovery initiatives for peace and reconciliation.
awareness of the rights of the individual, the enlargement of access to recourse to {{juridiques,}}
{{le}} and strengthening {{législatures}} and systems
Finally, the increase in the capacity of organisations and other representatives of civil society to participate fully and effectively in decision-making in their countries.
The government could use special measures on trade and aid if there are systematic and persistent violations of international rights of human rights.
{{canadienne,}} for example, must not in any way reward or give the impression to reward this kind of behaviour.
A number of ways can be used to this end, as stated by the {{Comité.}}
The government will study each case case.
In addition, trade in sensitive goods such as arms exports must not contribute to repression.
The conduct of Canada on this issue is illustrated by the controls that we have on exports of military goods, controls which are among the highest of the Western countries.
{{sont}} licences are {{entre}} among other things, when goods are to be used for a country where they could be used to abuse the rights of the person or when there are hostilities or a risk of {{imminentes.}}
The {{punitives,}} bilateral measures are usually the most effective way of obtaining the results of the results.
And in the case of trade, can it damage Canada more than they are {{le}}
The multilateral measures based on international standards and procedures have legitimacy and influence.
In this respect, it is very rare that the promotion of the rights of the person and trade are mutually {{exclusifs.}} objectives.
In fact, trade and prosperity can {{la}} the way to a more open society.
Experience shows that, when a closed country is exposed to the outside world and its values, the pressure for the rights of the person is strengthened.
However, in extreme cases and when it is considered effective, {{convenues}} commercial sanctions can allow effective pressure to be applied to change {{comme}} behaviour as was the case with South Africa.
Canada is ready to work very hard to define multilateral approaches that make consensus.
Canada will continue to promote the rights of the people in the United Nations, the OSCE, within the framework of the {{et}} and {{Francophonie,}} and {{l'OEA.}}
These bodies often provide the best {{pour}} to influence governments.
In the {{et}} and the various groups in the countries of aid, Canada will also insist on the need to take account of the commitment of the beneficiary country to the good government.
In particular, Canada {{la}} consultation with others to influence countries that spend a lot in the purchase of arms rather than in promoting education and education programmes for their population.
This review of foreign policy is not the end of a consultation.
On the contrary, it is the beginning of an ongoing process.
From now on, the government will take a forum on international relations of Canada, and it will be taken into account the useful suggestions made by the Committee on this matter.
The government of {{et}} and {{ce}} this process by {{des}} existing consultations with the community of NGOs in the field of the rights of the person and with the private sector within the Advisory Committee on External Trade {{et}} and {{de}} of sectoral consultations on external trade {{et}} and {{Groupes}}
These additional consultations {{d'autres}} other groups and individuals interested in the international dimensions of economic relations, development, and political affairs.
The government also decided to create a mechanism within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to stimulate public consultation and research on foreign policy issues.
The government will continue to consult Parliament, through special debates and other means, when there are important issues affecting foreign affairs, and to constantly update the guidelines of our foreign policy.
The government is taking into account the permanent committees concerned to open the way for public consultation.
As the {{nous}} suggests, we would be happy to provide {{avec}} consultations with the relevant parliamentary committees.
Finally, we would like to thank the members of the Special Joint Committee for their exceptional contribution to the development of our foreign policy and to help them to make a policy which {{Canadiens}} and {{pourront}} can be proud of.
We ask you, Mr {{coprésidents,}} the expression of our feelings of {{distingués.}}
Mr {{Ouellet}} {{Roy}} {{Roy}} {{Roy}} Minister for Foreign Trade Minister of Foreign Affairs
Members of the Special Joint Committee responsible for examining the foreign policy of Canada.
{{jointes}} {{(a/}} {{Réponse}} {{gouvernement}} of the government to the recommendations of the Joint Joint Committee for examining the foreign policy of {{Canada;}}
{{Énoncé}} {{de}} policy of {{étrangère.)}}
{{du}} of the government to the recommendations of the special Joint Parliamentary Committee for the examination of the foreign policy of Canada
This document contains the response of the {{à}} to each of the recommendations of the report by the Special Joint Parliamentary Committee for the examination of the foreign policy, the report entitled {{La}}
{{et}} and priorities for the future.
In the {{Comité,}} report the recommendations are not separated from the rest of the text and they are not {{numérotées.}}
The {{figurant}} in this document follows the order of the recommendations of the report by the Committee on the Committee to provide a full and {{intégrale.}} answer.
{{1:}} {{Repenser}} {{les}} the priorities of foreign policy
We believe that the resources for the instruments of foreign policy, and in particular the external service, should be allocated appropriately and proportionate to the objectives of the foreign policy which will {{de}} this report.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} is that the resources that it has to achieve the objectives of Canada on the international stage must be at the forefront of the situation.
But it is also important to deal with more and more limited financial resources in the current situation.
The {{des}} of the programmes under way will first and foremost be to establish correspondence between resources and priorities, in a context where innovation and moderation are {{rigueur.}}
The {{de}} of foreign policy must ensure that the priority objectives of Canada, in an international context in the rapid development and at a time when the resources of the {{dispose}} are limited.
The {{surveillera}} will constantly monitor its activities abroad to ensure that they highlight the commitment it has taken in the long term, that its internal and external policies are managed in a way that can guarantee its ability to influence world affairs while at the same time the effective changes on the international stage.
The {{modifiera}} will change the distribution of resources according to the development of priorities set out in its policy and will act according to the three major objectives of its foreign policy.
promoting prosperity and {{l'emploi;}}
protect our security in a global global framework.
{{les}} values and culture {{projeter}}
{{2:}} {{Renforcer}} {{la}} security
The Committee is convinced of the need to adopt a broader concept of security, including both military and military factors.
In addition, the committee recommends that this concept be reflected in both the establishment of a high-level mechanism within the government - the {{Cabinet,}} Committee by {{et}} and the restructuring of appropriate parliamentary committees in order to ensure the integrated treatment of the various security elements.
{{Le}} the need for a broader concept of security.
In addition to the well-known military threats, security policy must take into account the dangers for stability, democracy and {{durable;}} development here in the environment and the {{de}} of the environment, {{les}} movements of people and international crime.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Trade Trade {{établira}} will establish a high-level office relating to a Minister of {{qui}} who will take place in the study of the global challenges and who will have the task of harmonising the means that {{dispose}} has to make progress on matters such as those on {{:}}
The global environment, demographic growth, international migration including the whole issue of {{la}} international crime, the rights of the individual, democratisation, preventive diplomacy, and the consolidation of peace after conflicts.
The {{encouragera}} will encourage Parliament's permanent committees responsible for examining the whole range of security issues.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that measures are needed without delay to extend the Security Council to make it more {{représentatif.}}
It also believes that the Council must adopt more transparent working methods in order to facilitate communication between its members and countries that are not part of it, but which have interests to defend or particular concerns to be {{exprimer.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} promotes and strongly supports the reform of the Security Council, so that it works with cohesion, efficiency and credibility.
Many improvements have already been made, and the Council is working better today than in most of the previous times.
We can do more to complete the existing procedures without extending the Security Council, which would require the reform of the UN Charter of the United Nations {{(ONU).}}
In particular, Canada is cooperating with other Member States sharing its views to {{:}}
{{les}} the members of the Council will increase the countries of {{particulièrement}} particularly interested in the questions of the Council;
{{les}} the regional speakers involved involved in the Council debates.
Canada has contributed to the efforts made to bring the Security Council to consult the countries regularly providing troops when it comes to peacekeeping operations.
Canada is seeking to sit in the Security Council in {{afin}} in order to play a leading role in the development of the UN, when it comes into the next millennium.
If a reform of the composition of the Security Council becomes possible, Canada is going to increase its chances of having a place around the table.
The committee recommends that clear and uniform criteria to govern UN interventions and closer integration of political, economic and military measures to every stage of the UN peace mission are based on prevention.
It is also in favour of increasing the resources of the secretariat so that it can give rapid {{et}} and coordinate both the military contributions of the Member States and the other participants in peace missions.
At the same time, it would be good to look forward to decentralisation of peace operations at regional level, when it is feasible, so that if the Security Council decides that intervention is needed, it can allow a regional body to launch a precise operation under the auspices of the United Nations.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Canada is keen to promote reforms that would allow the UN to {{les}} the new dangers threatening peace.
So far, various constraints have limited the effectiveness of the UN.
Among other things, the countries of {{peu}} little on the opportunity of its speeches.
The diversity of situations which we have asked to face is a good example of how difficult it is to define solid and rapid intervention criteria.
However, the {{reconnaît}} recognises that it must work with its partners to draw up principles which are specifically {{concrètement}}
The White Paper on the defence of 1994 also {{aussi}} in this direction.
The second problem is that once the UN decides to take action, it is rare that it is easy for the resources to achieve its objectives.
From the beginning of a mission, it should be able to deploy the appropriate forces and that, on the {{d'opérations,}} {{d'opérations,}} it can count on a few and well equipped military personnel to deal with any development of the mandate of his speech.
Furthermore, the UN still lacks sufficient and easily accessible financial resources.
The {{estime}} believes that we must look at all these issues.
We are making proposals for the UN to count on independent financial resources of the contributions of its Member States.
In April 1994, Canada organised a working session for senior UN officials and representatives of the main countries of {{afin}} in order to define new ways of improving planning, preparation and implementation of peace operations.
As the Foreign Minister has announced in the United Nations General Assembly in 1994, Canada is currently leading a large international study, which it will be sending to the General Assembly in autumn 1995, and which deals with the various formulae that would improve the rapid reaction capacity of the UN.
The {{convient}} is fully needed to focus on rapid {{rapide}} and, in particular, on prevention.
The international community must be able to provide the conflicts in order not always to deal with their consequences.
We need to find innovative warning mechanisms that allow the crisis to be {{les}}
In this respect, Canada has presented a list of Canadian figures who would be prepared to take part in diplomacy missions.
The {{convient}} should be that regional organisations can play an important role in a safety system under the UN.
Canada supports the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the UN to encourage regional bodies, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which was previously called the {{l'Organisation}} the Organisation of American States {{et}} and the Organisation of African Unity {{à}} in {{conformément}} in accordance with the rules laid down by the United Nations, a wider share of the burden of international peacekeeping operations.
The Committee believes that the main role of Canadian {{canadiennes}} on the international stage should be to support the peacekeeping operations of peace, but it recommends that Canada is involved in a more selective way, after assessing its interests and determined the areas of {{tant}} both military and civilians, in which the {{excellent.}} {{excellent.}}
The training of the UN troops and staff peacekeeping staff should become one of the main elements of the {{canadienne.}} policy.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is resolved to continue to allocate elements of Canadian {{canadiennes}} to international peacekeeping operations.
Recent situations have shown that only the peacekeeping forces that are sufficiently equipped and armed and have received a good {{au}} in the fight can successfully face threats, armed attacks and other dangerous circumstances that risk {{surgir.}}
The {{a}} intends to provide Canadian {{canadiennes}} the means they need to fulfil their peace missions.
The {{convient,}} however, is that Canada cannot intervene throughout and everything to do so, and so it intends to make choices on its participation in peacekeeping operations.
In the White Paper on defence, the {{a}} set out various factors to take into account whether it is necessary to allocate Canadian resources to multilateral operations to protect peace and stability.
By defining the nature of its contribution, Canada will focus in particular on the roles in which it {{comme}} as the Committee on {{recommande.}}
Our country will continue to provide its know-how with regard to {{et}} and in other areas, to promote the consolidation of peace after conflicts.
It will also continue to provide its powers with regard to planning and preparation for peacekeeping operations and the logistical support that they will be {{même}} even in cases where Canadian troops cannot be part of the {{contingents.}}
Our great experience of peacekeeping and related missions confirms that the staff involved in this need for a whole range of competences.
A basic {{de}} in the fight is certainly essential, but staff must also have knowledge on the country concerned, its inhabitants and culture.
It has always been so, but it has always been so, but the {{de}} operations require military and more comprehensive knowledge than ever before.
That is why the {{consacre}} {{d'importantes}} important resources for the creation of the {{B.}} {{Lester}} Centre for the maintenance of peace, the former {{des}} of Canadian {{canadiennes}} {{Cornwallis}} {{(Nouvelle-Écosse).}}
The Centre will provide appropriate courses for the peacekeeping troops of all nations, and it will lead to research into the operations of this kind.
Thus, the experience gained by Canada over the last 40 years will benefit future {{bleus.}} {{bleus.}}
It is also clear that in support of democratic structures, the judiciary and free media, we can maintain peace when social systems are {{de}}
Effective police mediation and monitoring can give the same results if normal structures are {{structures}}
In the same way, enormous obstacles are being made to intervention units when peace {{après}} after the conflict.
That is why the {{tient}} wants to ensure that its own resources for peace missions serve to achieve a range of {{c'est}} it is also the reason why it promotes a {{dans}} approach in the implementation of UN peace operations.
The participation of the {{au}} to the restoration of peace and democracy in Haiti is a sign of the Canadian Government's resolution in this regard, as is the role played by the Canadian election observers in this country, in South Africa and elsewhere.
In addition, the {{a}} has provided the UN a list of Canadian civil experts capable of taking roles within the framework of {{et}} operations and encourages the {{de}} centre of {{à}} to integrate into its programmes in particular on the rights of the people for both military and civilians.
The Committee considers that Canada should remain an active member of NATO.
It should also encourage this organisation to become a collective security body for the whole of Europe, in cooperation with the members of the peace partnership.
In the same way, Canada should encourage NATO and the UN to maintain closer links and it should restructure the forces for NATO, in consultation with its allies, to better support the peacekeeping operations of NATO under the auspices of the United Nations or the OSCE.
Canada should also encourage the OSCE to strengthen its institutions, including those relating to prevention and conflict regulation, and to extend their procedures to enable them to intervene more quickly.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Canada is resolved to remain active in NATO and work to ensure that the Organisation is able to meet the current challenges and future and not those of the past.
With the dissolution of the Soviet bloc has disappeared a considerable source of concerns for the Atlantic Alliance.
Cooperation between its Member States for collective security {{malgré}} despite all its {{surtout}} especially in a world marked by instability and {{l'incertitude.}}
New problems threaten Europe's security.
There are ethnic {{ethniques}} and other social tensions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union.
Political and economic reforms are working hard and the results are {{incertains.}}
The destruction of the military {{militaires}} of the former Soviet Union is only a little short and the exercise of legitimate control over the past is causing {{grandissantes.}} concerns.
All these problems may have serious consequences for our security, and the {{estime}} believes that NATO can and must develop in order to deal with it.
The Atlantic Atlantic has the diplomatic influence of technical know-how and military resources to encourage all European states to be a greater sense of security.
{{ainsi}} to NATO a broader {{plus}} without creating new divisions in Europe, will certainly include difficulties, but we have to look at all the options available for us.
The {{croit}} believes that, in order to guarantee NATO success in this new role, we need to ensure that transparency, cooperation and coherence are characterised by relations between the Atlantic Alliance and other European institutions, such as the OSCE and the Western European Union.
In the same way, NATO must, in its part, ensure that the emergence of a wider international security system is taken into account by the UN {{de}}
It is in this context that the commitment made by Canada to NATO.
Our country has been among the most {{promoteurs}} {{du}} of the partnership for peace, the first step of an expansion in the Atlantic Alliance to lay the foundations for a broader European security regime to which Russia and the other countries of {{l'AUS.}}
In addition, Canada strongly promotes the establishment of special dialogue with the Russian Federation on the European security mechanisms in the future, so as to ensure that NATO developments take account of the concerns of the Union.
The {{convient}} also needs that NATO and the UN must work better between them in order to deal with the whole range of threats to stability in Europe.
Canada fully shares the concept of the operational operational groups combined by {{il}} adopted by the {{il}} there is an effective and {{coûteux}} way of organising the defence of the Alliance and to allocate the resources of the Union to peacekeeping and other operations that do not fall under the current NATO mandate.
Canada will continue to insist that the means of the {{(structures}} Alliance of {{logistique,}} logistics and other military and military resources are made available to the UN and the OSCE to help them to prepare and implement peacekeeping operations and other humanitarian tasks.
The {{est}} also agrees that the OSCE {{de}} capacity must be strengthened and {{conflits.}}
In the context of the Intergovernmental Conference held in Budapest, Canada worked very hard to improve the functioning of the conflict prevention centre.
It is actively working with other countries to provide the OSCE with an infrastructure to maintain peace, and it is prepared to share its know-how in this area with the OSCE Secretariat in Vienna, in order to help to plan a peacekeeping operation which has been proposed in the {{Nagorny-Karabakh.}}
Our country fully supports the work of the High Representative for national minorities and the Bureau of the democratic institutions and Human Rights {{deux}} two bodies created by the OSCE.
Canada is the OSCE of the OSCE to intervene in new plans, including media surveillance in order to prevent these becoming a propaganda instruments that could create instability and conflicts.
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that Canada is preparing to renew the {{NORAD}} agreement and calls for greater importance to be given to space surveillance than in the area of {{aérienne.}}
Canada should demand to be consulted on any measures to repeal the Treaty of limiting {{balistiques}} {{(TAM)}} {{ou}} or to place arms in space.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} is due to the committee that Canada has to negotiate a new renewal of the {{NORAD,}} agreement, while taking into account the changes in the nature of the threats to North America, new technologies and challenges in the future.
Canada continues to oppose the repeal or weakening of the Treaty on {{balistiques}} {{antimissiles}} {{(ABM)}} ratified by {{ainsi}} and the deployment of weapons in space.
Canada notes with satisfaction that the US Government has decided to stick to the restrictive interpretation of the {{ABM.}} Treaty.
We have seen with interest in recent years the policy and the United States' defence strategy moving towards the recovery of the {{antimissiles,}} {{antimissiles,}} {{antimissiles,}} based on soil or sea.
At the moment, Canada wants to better understand the {{antimissile,}} defence of research and consultation of countries of the same view.
If Canada decided to play a role at the level of {{balistique,}} defence {{antimissile}} this role would not be determined in an isolated way, but on the contrary, in conjunction with the development of the arrangements for the {{de}} defence of North America and, perhaps, all NATO countries.
In order to ensure that Canada is involved in such a defence, it should be supported by an {{qu'elle}} analysis that it will undoubtedly respond to our needs, and that it will undoubtedly make it possible to strengthen the tasks that our {{exécutent}} already have as monitoring and communications.
Canada will continue a dialogue on these issues with the United States, both outside and within the {{NORAD.}}
The Committee welcomes the efforts of the members of the Organisation of American States {{pour}} to increase their cooperation on security issues within the wider UN framework.
It supports the {{visant}} initiative to create a special committee for {{pour}} to examine these issues.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
It has a great deal to do with the countries of the {{des}} of their own relations to emphasise the role of Canada as a whole.
This commitment also concerns the joint efforts to safeguard peace in the region, thanks to the application of the UN principles.
The creation of the special Committee on {{(CSC)}} {{Comité}} was proposed by Canada.
We have also {{une}} a meeting of experts on confidence and security measures.
{{à}} in Buenos Aires in March 1994, it was the first gender meeting in {{Amériques.}}
We look forward to the {{de}} regional conference which must take place this year in {{Santiago.}}
Canada recommends the adoption of a broader concept of security {{concept}} the concept which takes account of a range of threats since the internal conflicts and {{jusqu'à}} until pollution and environmental {{environnementale.}}
In {{le}} Canada is trying to improve cooperation between {{et}} and the UN.
It also calls for the creation of a regional register of conventional arms transfers and military expenditure and for the adoption of prevention and conflict regulation.
At the beginning of Canada, technology is also looking at the effects of the use without discrimination against landmines in certain parts of the continent.
It supports an examination of the Commission's {{de}} mechanisms in order to improve the operation, transparency and financial {{financière.}}
Our country wishes to strengthen {{en}} by making a permanent committee of {{et}} and providing it with a regular and {{qui}} work programme which would make it more difficult for the Organisation to increase security and promote democratic institutions, respect for human rights, and the rule of law on the continent.
The {{se}} will also look at democratic development and the good government, within the framework of the follow-up to the decisions taken at the recent summit of {{à}} in {{Miami.}}
{{Le}} the Committee considers that Canada should support initiatives such as the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asia {{afin}} in order to establish a dialogue on cooperative security in the region and thus gradually to bring about regional security agreements.
As a country of the Pacific {{du}} Canada should play an active role in this chapter, show that it has interests to protect in the Pacific and to ensure that there is a more visible {{plus}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is {{il}} he has taken and will continue to take action to demonstrate its commitment to open dialogue on cooperative security in the Pacific.
The action of Canada in favour of dialogue on the security of {{a}} has led to the creation of the Regional Forum in {{(FRA).}}
It encourages the work of the past now that it is established.
Canada has drafted working documents on conflict prevention and non-proliferation for the {{du}} session of the Forum at the summer of 1994 and, at the request of this year, experts from our country are currently preparing additional {{supplémentaires}} on these issues and others.
Canada also contributes to the organisation of a {{sur}} for peace that {{doit}} must present in March 1995.
As the White Paper on defence, the {{compte}} is to maintain a visible shipbuilding presence in the Pacific.
The {{Vancouver}} {{s'est}} visited Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1994, and Canada will send two ships into the ASEAN region during the summer of 1995.
The Committee believes that Canada, together with the countries that are the same opinion, should do everything possible to bring about more countries to sign the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons {{renforcer}} strengthening the {{TNP,}} regime to support the extension of the Treaty, to convince the nuclear powers to reduce their {{et}} and to continue the campaign for a total ban on nuclear testing.
Canada should insist that all Member States should be obliged to make statements on the {{des}} of the United Nations {{et}} and it should call for the internal markets to be {{aussi}}
It should also recommend the ban on arms sales to countries which do not present a statement to {{comme}} as the Canadian Committee for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations has {{recommandé.}}
The control of production, the import and export of landmines should be {{spéciaux.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} agrees with the Committee on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Nuclear proliferation continues to put a heavy threat to international security.
The NPT is the instrument that the members of the world community have together to contain this {{notre}} our security depends on universal accession to its provisions.
However, some states believe that the negotiations on a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests {{ne}} are not progressing quickly, and that is now likely to jeopardise the extension of the NPT for a long time.
In addition, before giving approval to such a {{des}} Member States are calling for the guarantee that no country {{ou}} or {{d'utiliser}} nuclear weapons, which guarantees the negative safety {{de}} which would have led to {{et}} and {{prochaine}} next round of talks on a convention for the judgment of the production of {{destinées}} {{fissiles}}
Many states in the NPT believe that this is discriminatory and that in the {{pour}} for a period of {{on}} the existing inequality between states with nuclear weapons and other people is {{l'inégalité}}
The maintenance of the NPT is therefore faced with the challenges even though its importance is {{dans}} in a world which is increasingly outside the control of nuclear {{nucléaires.}}
Canada will continue to do everything possible to encourage the accession of all countries to {{TNP.}}
It is actively working with {{et}} and others in order to achieve a consensus for the renewal of the Treaty for a period of {{illimitée.}}
It is preparing to combine its efforts with those other countries sharing its {{du}} views of South and Japan, by {{pour}} to encourage moderate and pragmatic reflection on {{TNP.}}
The special relations that Canada has with Ukraine have contributed to the success of international efforts to convince this country to join the {{TNP.}}
Canada is working hard to achieve a sustainable and {{d'interdiction}} treaty for the full ban on nuclear weapons, and it leads to the efforts that the international community is making to initiate negotiations on the judgment of the production of {{destinées}} materials for the manufacture of {{ainsi}} and presented an international {{international}} on this issue in January {{1995).}}
The {{convient}} should also be that the proliferation of conventional weapons is also a danger, and it is currently looking at ways that would allow the international community to deal with this problem effectively.
Canada has, from the outset, made a lawyer of the United Nations {{de}} {{transferts}} {{transferts}}
It continues to declare its national production of material material.
In 1994, it led the group of countries which wanted to add national production to {{et}} and to make further improvements.
Canada will continue to encourage all countries voluntarily to declare their military {{militaires}} and it believes that the success of the {{en}} as a measure of strengthening confidence will encourage countries to support the understanding of it.
While pursuing its multilateral efforts in favour of universal accession to {{le}} Canada will continue to examine whether it is effective to ban arms exports to {{non-membres}} countries and to try to force the Member States to provide information to the {{Registre.}}
The {{convient}} is important to limit the proliferation and use of anti-personnel mines.
Canada has not exported {{anti-personnel}} mines since 1987 and seeks to strengthen the UN Convention on certain conventional weapons {{et}} and in particular Protocol II on the employment of {{en}} with a view to the 1995 review conference.
Canada is looking at ways of extending the scope of the Convention, so that it also applies to internal conflicts {{le}} the framework for which the majority of {{sont}} landmines are {{et}} and to adopt a verification regime which will increase even more efficiency.
Canada is also working with other countries interested in this issue, for {{à}} to other effective international controls on the transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.
{{Le}} the Committee considers it essential for both Canada and Canada to maintain its reputation as a respected member of the international community, which Canada continues to contribute to strengthening international security.
It recommends that the Canadian {{canadiennes}} should be given a more specialised form of providing them with better support for peacekeeping operations.
However, the committee has reservations about excessive {{excessive}} of {{canadiennes.}} {{canadiennes.}}
{{Le}} the {{convient}} is due to the committee that Canada can and must continue to contribute to international security, as well as its resources and its {{sur}} on the world stage.
As the White Paper on defence, the {{est}} is resolved to allocate more Canadian military troops to international peacekeeping operations.
In addition, in order to help ensure that all existing competences are fully {{le}} the {{contribue}} contributes to establishing an international centre {{aux}} to peacekeeping operations in {{(Nouvelle-Écosse).}} {{(Nouvelle-Écosse).}} {{(Nouvelle-Écosse).}}
At the same time, it is convinced that the success of the peace missions fundamentally requires the employment of armed armed forces and capable of {{combat;}} as the Committee {{il}} it will continue to be too {{Forces}}
{{3:}} {{Vers}} Towards prosperity
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that the Federal Government in consultation with the provinces and taking into account their views is an effective way of providing a way of giving some responsibilities for commercial promotion to a more {{indépendant,}} {{plus}}
{{géré}} managed jointly by the public sector and the private sector, which would provide businesses, particularly small and medium-sized {{de}} of current information and on the markets and marketing strategies.
This body should be particularly interested in the difficulties in opening up new {{davantage}} more appropriations should be granted when the market is {{et}} and its {{requiert}} requires difficult foreign languages or {{familières.}} societies.
{{pourraient}} costs could be imposed on the basis of the ability to {{contributive.}}
If it is true that we must preserve our traditional markets, we should also increase our efforts to actively find new markets.
{{Le}} is the need to make a greater part of the provinces and the private sector in the development of its {{de}} trade to provide information for companies in real time on the markets and strategies of {{et}} and to devote more resources to the {{naissants.}} markets.
In order to achieve these objectives, the {{compte}} {{:}}

At the first time, the {{a}} has already {{à}} in the last markets {{ex.,}} {{l'Asie}} Asia and Latin America, a part of the resources reserved for the development of international trade, and it will take other {{de}} of funds in this same {{esprit;}}

The {{a}} has studied the proposal on the creation of an independent body that would be responsible for achieving the objectives of Canada on the development of international trade.
It is important that its trade development strategy should take place as soon as possible.
It will continue to promote the participation of the private sector as a whole.
However, it takes into account the current regime, given that the useful trade and political links resulting from the integration of the {{au}} service in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade {{international;}}
The growing convergence of trade policy and the development activities of trade trade
And the importance of providing the foreign policy with a strong economic and commercial dimension.
The {{estime}} believes that there is no need to impose rights to use this {{car}} because they could discourage companies from exporting their products for the first time.
However, there are other ways of {{davantage}} the costs and share of them with the private sector.
In order to consolidate the position of Canada in the context of the {{le}} the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} Canada should insist that the dispute settlement procedure should be applied in a fair manner, and continue to exert strong pressure to ensure that the negotiations on the codes of {{concernant}} concerning subsidies and dumping will result in 1996, as was originally planned in order to be able to adopt common rules which are {{aux}} to the current laws on trade sanctions applied by the signatories of {{l'ALENA;}}
If these negotiations were to {{le}} the government of Canada should review the options that are available.
{{Le}} the {{va}} will ensure the fair application of the {{de}} procedure of disputes described in Chapter 20 of the Free Trade Agreement {{(ALENA).}} {{(ALENA).}}
This mechanism is a sensitive improvement in relation to the procedure laid down in the free trade agreement between Canada and the United States.
A list of people {{par}} by consensus, the opposite process is the opposite of special groups, the scientific review committees and the exercise of control on excessive {{rétorsion,}} measures that are all effective means to ensure that the rules of {{l'Accord.}} are respected.
The {{s'engage}} is also committed to ensuring that any improvement in the dispute settlement procedure is integrated into future negotiations on the accession of Chile in {{et}} and on the achievement of the objective that the leaders of the {{se}} have recently set up - to create the free trade of {{(ZLEA).}} {{(ZLEA).}}
The {{estime}} believes that it is necessary to establish good codes of discipline concerning subsidies and dumping for the partners of {{l'ALENA.}}
On 2 December 1993, the Prime Minister announced that Canada, Mexico and the United States had agreed to seek to reduce the risk of disputes relating to subsidies, dumping and application of the laws on commercial use of such practices.
In accordance with the {{on}} agreement, two working groups have set up two working groups, one looks at subsidies and {{et}} and the other on the mechanisms of {{anti-dumping.}}
The {{accorde}} is of the utmost importance to this process and it will do everything possible to ensure that in December 1995, the risks of disputes with the United States are reduced and that then we are moving forward to a further reform of reform.
In order to consolidate the position of Canada in the context of the {{le}} the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} the government should also make it clear that the provision of {{concernant}} concerning the exemption of cultural products should not be interpreted in a way which could jeopardise the interests of the cultural groups in Canada.
{{Afin}} in order to maintain its identity and {{le}} Canada must preserve in the cultural area of {{une}} a good place for him, a place of choice.
Therefore, maintaining the exemption from cultural industries was an essential objective of Canada during the {{l'ALENA,}} negotiations, as well as the conservation of several support measures.
The {{prévoit}} states that any measures adopted or maintained relatively to cultural industries are exclusively {{à}}
We are maintaining the right to maintain existing support measures or to create others.
However, {{autorise}} allows the United States to {{en}} by adopting measures with an equivalent commercial effect if Canada takes action that would have been contrary to {{n'eût}} {{été}} was the clause on the {{culturelle.}}
In practice, this provision allows for the support of the cultural industries of the measures which are not only in line with the international obligations of Canada, but for which the right to {{en}} under {{ne}} does not apply.
It is important that national and international policies on the various Canadian interests are balanced and complement and mutually mutually {{mutuellement.}}
Many Canadian companies support the competition of American and foreign cultural companies, on national and foreign markets.
Furthermore, Canadian companies have benefited from a strong trend in favour of trade alliances and {{coproductions.}}
The {{doit}} must therefore take all these considerations into account when choosing the appropriate strategic instruments to protect and promote the culture of culture.
The {{est}} is resolved to promote the development and growth of cultural industries.
It has already implemented a number of innovative measures that highlight its commitment to a dynamic cultural sector.
In order to consolidate the position of Canada in the context of the {{le}} the committee recommends what is {{:}}
The government should also seek more support for the multilateral bodies in the multilateral bodies which are generally accepted to establish a better and fairer trade law in these matters.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
In multilateral terms, Canada is one of the most active participants in the general agreement on customs tariffs and {{(GATT),}} trade and the creation of the World Trade Organisation {{a}} has been a priority for it.
It intends to continue to call for comprehensive and precise rules on subsidies, dumping, {{et}} measures and {{et}} rights and take measures to promote more {{et}} and {{d'équité.}}
It will not be easy to {{des}} international rules in this area, given the fact that there are important markets of interest groups which make commercial use of their protectionist instrument of {{et}} and given the proliferation of these use in many developing countries in recent years.
The {{fait}} is facing this challenge by implementing a {{qui}} strategy which promotes the creation of a wider multilateral coalition among the countries that call for reform, and the intensification of efforts in the context of {{l'ALENA.}}
This work carried out at various levels and in various {{renforcent}} strengthens the multilateral regulatory system that remains the basis of the {{Canada.}} trade policy.
As regards culture, the interests of Canada are fully protected by the exemptions negotiated for cultural industries in {{l'ALENA,}} {{le}} GATT and the WTO agreement.
In order to improve the Canada position on international trade at global level, the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} the government should make the notion of a multilateral system based on rules the first principle of Canada policy on international trade.
Let us ensure that the current bilateral and regional trade agreements go hand in hand with the objectives of multilateral agreements, and the possible impact of all new bilateral or regional negotiations on the current and future multilateral agreements on international trade.
{{Le}} the {{est}} agrees and supports that a multilateral regime based on rules is the best option for the {{Canada.}} trade policy.
It has also adopted the draft {{C-57}} law on the implementation of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation {{instituant}} which reaffirms that such a regime remains the cornerstone of trade policy {{la}}
The {{continuera}} will also continue to ensure that bilateral and regional trade agreements to which the country {{complètent}} its international objectives.
GATT and the WTO define a set of international rules and procedures for the conduct of trade trade.
{{respecte}} respects the GATT requirements with regard to free trade while adopting rules and procedures according to the special parameters of our relations with our most important trading partner.
{{favorise}} also promotes the achievement of our multilateral objectives by {{pas}} barriers to other countries and {{les}} barriers to trade in several sectors which are not covered by the {{GATT.}}
The {{estime}} believes that bilateral and regional agreements can promote the examination of issues which have not yet been heard in the multilateral {{multilatérales.}}
It is convinced that the progress made by bilateral and regional agreements tend to stimulate the liberalisation of trade in the multilateral context.
We have made economic {{économiques}} in North America through {{et}} and {{l'ALENA.}}
The {{travaille}} is now working on the establishment of {{à}} links by calling for Chile to {{et}} and the creation of a free trade {{Amériques}}
It also seeks to strengthen its economic and trade relations with the European Union and the countries bordering the Pacific.
Canada is actively seeking to seize the opportunities offered by it.
The statement that the {{de}} Cooperation Organisation {{a}} has recently made in {{relativement}} relatively much to the elimination of barriers to trade and investment in the region by 25 years shows the commitment of Canada.
Similarly, the release of the {{démontre}} summit shows that Canada, together with other countries of the continent, is resolved to promote the liberalisation of trade and investment throughout Latin America and in the {{Antilles.}}
In order to improve the Canada position on international trade at global level, the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} Canada, in cooperation with other countries, should ensure that the World Trade Organisation {{ait}} has a truly universal and multilateral nature and the greatest possible number of {{basées}} based on compliance with generally accepted standards.
The {{est}} is in agreement and will continue to ensure that the WTO {{un}} a truly universal and multilateral nature and that it will take the greatest possible number of members in respect of the generally accepted standards.
More than 100 economies of all parts of the world have participated in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which lasted over seven and a half years.
One hundred of 25 have now signed the agreement establishing the WTO and 81 of them - the {{l'avaient}} ratified the {{l'avaient}} ratified by 1 January 1995, thus becoming the founding members of the {{l'Organisation.}}
We expect others to do so during a transitional period.
Canada and other interested parties are also working hard to enable key economies, such as China, Taiwan and the Russian Federation, as well as 20 other economies that Ukraine, to join the GATT and the WTO as full members of the multilateral trade system.
These economies will benefit the same rights and will be {{aux}} to the same obligations as the current members.
In order to improve Canada in the long term in terms of trade at global level, the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} Canada should insist that the WTO should pay its first attention to the export subsidies of agricultural products, standards relating to environmental protection and {{main-d'oeuvre,}}
Above all, the general issue of trade sanctions and the particular problem of the worrying proliferation of {{antidumping.}} measures.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} is that the WTO should be able to pay attention to commercial use and export subsidies.
The {{préconise}} strongly advocates the adoption of stricter international rules on the use of subsidies for agricultural exports, and it is continuing to take steps which are the full ban on using these subsidies.
Canada {{par}} through the WTO, to mobilise the support of all countries.
The reports between the environment and the trade system have already been discussed in the GATT to the Organisation of Cooperation and Economic Development {{et}} and in other organisations.
Canada and its WTO trading partners agreed to create a Committee on Trade and the Environment which will examine these issues more closely and which will make recommendations on whether the multilateral trade rules should be changed.
The International Labour Organisation {{et}} and the OECD have, with the support of Canada, made a study on the reports between the multilateral trade system and international labour standards.
In view of the complex nature of the issues that are also likely to generate {{ces}} these two bodies will be {{leur}} their analysis further in order to present the issue to the WTO.
Canada is keen to ensure that the WTO limits more and more frequent use of commercial use, including the mechanisms of mechanisms.
This is all the more important because the number of anti-dumping investigations has increased in {{et}} and one year to another.
The phenomenon is an increase in the number of countries that have adopted laws on commercial use rather than through the increased use of this form of protection.
As far as the position of the United States and the European Union is concerned, it will be possible to continue to assert the primacy of the law on unilateral measures by encouraging accession to a set of trade rules and procedures that improve with time.
In order to improve Canada in the long term in terms of trade at global level, the committee recommends what is {{:}}
{{le}} Canada should use all the opportunities to assert the principle of greater liberalisation of trade {{par}} by rules.
The Committee recommends that the government, in its study of the reform of the Bretton Woods system, in preparation for the {{G-7}} Summit in {{établisse}} establishes a strategy for the World Trade Organisation {{à}} to the Organisation of Cooperation and Economic Development {{ainsi}} as well as the international financial institutions, the strategy to maintain the active role of Canada in a global economy based on rules.
This strategy should be submitted to Parliament and examined by the permanent permanent committees.
{{Le}} the {{va}} will continue to assert the principle of the liberalisation of increased trade and based on rules in all the {{où}} where Canada is {{et}} and with which it can exert an essential impact, including {{l'APEC,}} {{l'OCDE,}} the OECD, the {{(G-7)}} {{des}} Group and the {{des}} of the {{Quadrilatérale.}} {{du}}
In this respect, the Economic Summit of the {{qui}} which must be held in {{en}} in June 1995 and the work that the trade ministers in {{mènent}} lead to the summit offer excellent opportunities to promote the liberalisation of trade and investment.
At the summit in {{le}} Canada will call for the main trade powers to commit to the rapid consolidation of the WTO system and to speed up the preparatory work needed to identify the major future issues.
By the summit in {{et}} and during this year, Canada will seek to strengthen cooperation between the main industrialised countries to enable the Bretton Woods system to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
The establishment of the rules of the game and building a global economy based on rules are essential for Canada and are an integral part of the reform process.
The ministers are {{les}} the members of the permanent permanent committees on the prospects for the summit at a suitable and {{à}} date on this occasion.
In view of the commitment of Canada on regional trade, the committee recommends that the government has a policy of two aspects of supporting the enlargement of {{à}} to other countries, while strengthening its political and economic presence in Latin America.
And by trying to develop its trade relations with Mexico and other trading partners.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
The recent visit by the Prime Minister in Latin America, accompanied by the Minister of International Trade and the Secretary of State of State {{latine}} {{et}} shows the desire of Canada to strengthen its relations with the region.
The {{souhaite}} wants to fully extend {{pour}} to accept the countries or groups of countries that are ready and able to accept their obligations.
Therefore, Canada, the United States and Mexico have announced the launch of the process that will lead to the accession of Chile in {{l'ALENA.}}
In addition, Canada would like to see other partners in the {{adhèrent}} who can possibly {{l'ALENA,}} and will soon start preliminary talks in this direction.
However, enlargement will only be a part of the intensification of relations with the countries of the region.
Canada continues to consolidate its cooperation with the states of the region by actively participating in the work of the Organisation of American States {{dans}} in areas such as human rights, the development of democracy, regional security, technical cooperation, the fight against drugs and, more recently, environmental issues.
{{fait}} regularly calls on the leadership of Canada in many of these areas, and it is often estimated that it serves a {{entre}} between the United States and the other countries in the region.
In addition, close relations with the countries of the continent on several issues have encouraged the conclusion of valuable strategic alliances in other international {{internationales,}} including the United Nations.
In the number of other important institutional and economic links between Canada and Latin America, this is the accession of our country to the {{interaméricaine}} Development Bank, the agreements on the protection of foreign investment signed with Argentina and {{et}} and the double taxation conventions established with Brazil, Argentina and several countries of {{Antilles.}}
We recommend that the government is actively seeking trade prospects in the {{Asie-Pacifique.}} region.
Its success will depend on its ability to make better use of the markets in the region and to take specific initiatives to make a greater comparative advantage of the exporters of {{canadiens.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
The recent visit by the Prime Minister in several countries in the region, accompanied by the International Trade Minister and the Secretary of State of State {{témoigne}} shows the desire of Canada to strengthen its relations with the region.
We are {{la}} the liberalisation of trade and investment in the Pacific aware of our priority objectives for access to markets and the need to fully respect the GATT agreements and the WTO.
Canada is one of the founding members of the {{et}} and actively supports the {{amorcé}} movement to liberalise trade in the region by 2020.
{{constitue}} is a forum where we can encourage the accelerated achievement of the commitments made on access to the markets during the Uruguay Round and also a workshop where new dossiers {{ex.,}} {{les}} {{les}} {{douanières;}} {{douanières;}} links between trade and {{l'environnement).}}
At the same time, in addition to the efforts it is making on the world stage and in the {{le}} Canada is prepared to take concerted bilateral steps to eliminate significant obstacles that have been caused for a long time in trade with certain partners.
We are {{nos}} our trade programmes in the {{Asie-Pacifique,}} region by giving priority to the following aspects.
{{le}} the concept of {{Commerce}} {{Commerce}} in Canada {{comme}} as in China recently, to encourage {{et}} governments and commercial associations to express the capacity and will of Canada to conduct business in the {{région;}}
increase and strengthen the presence of Canadian companies on the {{l'Asie-Pacifique;}} markets.
focus our participation in the {{et}} and commercial missions on the sectors and countries offering the best prospects for exporters in {{canadiens;}}
{{des}} programmes adapted to the situation and the characteristics of SMEs
{{toute}} their importance to investment in our trade development strategy, by highlighting their role in the development of trade, technology and industry in Canada and on the possibility of cooperating with third countries.
It is to work closely with the Canadian business circles to ensure that, in our efforts, we will be able to make the best possible of our benefits in our efforts.
We will be able to acquire technologies, an economically profitable and {{ainsi}} plan and a coherent strategy on science and technology for {{en}} by ensuring that the plan and strategy reflect the national priorities relating to {{et}} and D and to industrial expansion and are coordinated with existing programmes.
In this way, we will {{nos}} our public and private sectors and our research sector to the dynamics of innovation and scientific development in the region of {{Asie-Pacifique,}}
We will help to strengthen our industrial base and our means of research, and to improve our trade and investment prospects.
We will encourage the expansion and coordination of efforts in specific sectors.
We will actively seek to maintain our share of the agricultural and traditional agricultural products.
In the areas of added value, we will focus on the following {{suivants}}
{{énergie,}} energy, the environment, the environment, energy, construction materials and food {{de}} consumer goods and training.
These are sectors where Canada {{et}} and the Asian markets will promote the development of our industry and job creation.
We will also try to adapt the related and complementary policies and programmes in areas such as air transport, the issuing of visas and the financing of exports, to increase the promotion efforts.
{{Le}} the committee recommends that the government should draw up a long-term plan to bring companies into an international direction, which is {{dans}} within the framework of an integrated trade strategy and would be the result of cooperation with interested governments.
higher education institutions and cultural institutions, as well as companies should participate in this strategy.
We also recommend that the government should be given the commitment of the provinces at a joint plan to create {{des}} programmes and other programmes designed to create an Canadian {{canadiens}} {{vers}} on abroad.
The international trade context is becoming increasingly {{vite.}}
It is characterised by {{:}}
Liberalisation of trade and investment rules at national level and by means of international instruments {{ex.,}} the WTO and {{l'ALENA);}}
The entry into place of many new competitors seeking to {{une}} a share of the market and attract investment {{qualité;}}
{{plus}} mobility of {{capitaux;}}
And the accelerated pace of technological innovations, which facilitates all these changes and which is due to them.
The new context is for human resources {{et}} and aware of global trade issues.
The {{est}} agrees with the recommendation and will examine with the provinces of new ways of putting the existing programmes to benefit in order to give a more international approach to commercial training in Canada.
{{du}} Canadian service {{jouera}} will play its role.
It is now responsible for improving the skills of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Trade Policy.
{{présente}} has regular courses on a range of international issues, including the promotion of trade, trade policy, and foreign languages.
In its next {{quinquennal,}} plan {{l'Institut}} the Institute of {{le}} the framework for its programmes to make use of other ministries {{les}} the {{et}} governments and the private sector.
The International Trade Forum {{enseigne}} has taught companies from all Canada to conduct business abroad.
It will continue to develop and develop on the basis of the needs of training of {{transigeant}} {{transigeant}} on foreign markets.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has created research centres in international administration in the administration of eight {{canadiennes.}} {{canadiennes.}}
These centres provide courses for an increasing number of {{ainsi}} as well as training and consultation services.
They also encourage practical research to support these education programmes and thus promote the development of international trade.
In accordance with the values expressed with conviction by the {{le}} the committee recommends that the government of Canada choose the most effective routes to protest against the serious violations of the rights of the individual, labour standards and the principles of environmental protection, where it is possible, and that it is working closely when it is possible, with its partners that share the same views in order to achieve {{d'une}} in a way compatible with the {{d'un}} development of a multilateral trade trading system.
Trade sanctions in a multilateral context should be considered in a multilateral context.
{{Les}} {{Canadiens}} have always been committed to human rights, and they continue to do so.
Since the time in which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up until a more recent time, the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Canada has remained at the forefront of those who are fighting to preserve fundamental freedoms and human dignity.
{{l'exposé}} the most comprehensive statement on the rights of the person in the answer to the recommendation {{5.11).}}
Respect for international labour standards is important because of its intrinsic value and because it contributes to strengthening the economic security of {{et}} and {{Canadiennes.}}
As far as the {{le}} is concerned, Canada is particularly seeking to understand the existing reports between international trade and labour standards, {{au}} within the OECD and the ILO and to take part in the trade unions, industry and the provinces in drawing up a detailed position on this issue.
As far as environmental protection is concerned, the efforts that Canada is currently doing in the OECD, in {{à}} to {{et}} {{l'ISO}} and {{d'intervenants}} here even in the country are aimed at strengthening international standards and {{conformité.}} mechanisms.
Canada and its WTO partners also agreed to create a Committee on Trade and the Environment which will make recommendations on the links between these two elements.
However, the {{imposées}} measures imposed without the help of other countries, are usually the least effective way of obtaining the desired results in the case of trade, even if they are likely to harm Canada more than they are {{des}} changes in the behaviour of the governments concerned.
The multilateral action based on international standards and procedures gives legitimacy to the steps taken and increase the {{l'effet.}}
In this respect, it is very rare that the promotion of the rights of the person and the free trade will be {{des}}
In fact, trade and increasing economic prosperity often promote the development of a more open society.
Experience shows that it is useful to make it clear to closed countries the values of the international community to increase the pressure for human rights.
In spite of everything, in extreme cases and when they are effective, multilateral trade sanctions can contribute to changing {{comme}} behaviour as was the case in South Africa.
Canada is ready to work very hard to define multilateral approaches that make consensus.
We also need to ensure that the trade in sensitive goods such as military exports is not used to intensify repression.
The conduct of Canada on this issue is {{par}} by the controls that we have on exports of military goods, controls which are among the highest of the Western countries.
{{sont}} licences are {{entre}} among other things, when goods are to be used for a country where they could be used to abuse the rights of the person or when there are hostilities or {{d'hostilités}}
In order to succeed, the proposals to link labour standards and the environment to the trade system must give broad support to the international community.
{{prises}} trade measures against countries for reasons relating to environmental standards or labour would damage multilateral multilateral trade regulations.
{{la}} the achievement of our fundamental objective {{observation}} observation of the rules by the countries and strengthening the system of regulatory {{multilatérale),}}
{{exposeraient}} Canada to unilateral measures other countries, thereby jeopardising our prosperity and our ability to support appropriate standards in the circumstances of {{canadiennes.}}
In addition, the Committee recommends that any study of the operations of the international financial institutions is comprehensive and that it concerns the way in which the tasks between the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are clearly distributed and the relations of these institutions with other institutions such as regional development banks.
In particular, we should try to make their operations more effective, more transparent, more responsible and more sensitive to the principles of respect for the rights of the individual, social justice, the preservation of the environment and the participation of local populations.
Finally, the committee recommends that the Canadian ministers concerned, as well as the Canadian {{canadiens}} of the World Bank, the IMF and the regional development banks will be invited once a year before the parliamentary committees responsible for foreign affairs and finance in order to account for the activities of these institutions.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} agrees that the examination of the operations of the international financial institutions must take into account all the relevant aspects of the direction of these institutions and the management of {{portefeuilles.}}
{{font}} are facing major challenges.
They must facilitate the adjustment of savings to the rapid increase in cross-border trade operations, investment and technology.
They must also deal with the intensification of competition on the market, where the action of many developing countries is more effective.
With the concerns of the volatility of exchange rates and the relevance of the rules applicable to international currencies and transactions in other areas.
And with the abandonment of economic {{économique}} in most of the Communist world.
{{comptent}} are among the main instruments we have to ensure that this great transformation is effective.
In addition, Canada is at the forefront of efforts to improve the quality of the World Bank portfolios in order to make its operations more effective and transparent and make the Bank itself, more sensitive to these issues and the Member States, the public and NGOs.
These efforts are {{aux}} to the other international financial institutions and to the various groups of donor countries in which Canada will highlight the need to take account of the extent to which aid {{de}} respect the rights of the person and apply the good government.
In all multilateral development banks, we will continue to insist on the need to give priority to the environment, to {{de}} poverty, and to sound management of public affairs.
The banks are reacting but much remains to be done.
All banks have drawn up and implemented directives on environmental assessments.
We will continue to encourage them to put these directives into force by giving them all the important {{voulue.}}
The {{mettra}} will make the parliamentary committees available by ministers and officials.
The Finance Minister has already presented annual reports before Parliament on the functioning of the IMF, the World Bank and the {{BERD,}}
And the Foreign Minister intends to present annual reports on other multilateral development banks whose Canada is a member.
{{Le}} Canada has already taken the {{de}} of debt to some countries, but the Committee is of the opinion that it is important to consider other bilateral and multilateral actions to remedy the crisis of the poorest countries in particular, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, these measures must not jeopardise the funding of long-term development aid.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} in this direction.
In the {{et}} and the Paris {{de}} {{l'on}} where bilateral debt is {{de}} that is to say funds due to {{à}} {{SEE}} and the Commission {{du}} {{blé,}} by {{exemple),}}
Canada has for a long time been encouraging the {{à}} countries to make a higher contribution to the {{surendettés}} countries which include many countries in Africa in Africa.
The members of the Paris {{de}} have recently heard an improved approach, which allows for the previous maximum threshold to be put to EUR 67 {{100}} {{(le}} of the {{se}} debt of these poorest countries, including, for the first time, the whole debt of the countries which have been set up for the first time, in the event of such a case.
{{à}} to such a measure, within the framework of efforts made to implement policies which will lead to sustainable economic sustainability.
When Canada is involved in the {{de}} initiatives including those taken by the {{Paris),}} {{de}} its contribution is financed as a reserve fund created in 1990.
So it is not at the expense of {{l'APD.}}
The World Bank is currently examining the problem of increasing the sums that the poorest countries have to the multilateral institutions.
Canada {{des}} innovative means to help the countries of {{à}} low income to manage their debt.
{{canadienne}} bilateral {{bilatérale}} is offered in the form of subsidies.
Canada continues to encourage other countries to remove debt from being given due to {{l'APD}} or {{et}} and to provide {{sous}} in the form of subsidies or {{seulement.}}
{{4:}} {{Contribuer}} {{au}}
The Committee is convinced that the concept of sustainable development must be a key guiding theme of foreign policy.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Canada will continue to strengthen the capacity of its Canadian and foreign partners to deal with reports that exist between environmental sustainability and social development.
If it is to be implemented effectively, sustainable development must be fully integrated into the environmental, economic and social factors including political and social factors.
In the examination of a particular question, the country or the context of international institutions or agreements of international development must be examined in a balanced manner.
The idea of sustainable development in the foreign policy of Canada is the recognition of national and global challenges.
We can see in Canada and other parts of the world the effects of {{durable}} development, for example, to the collapse of the fishing industry on the eastern coast of {{Canada).}}
Often, the challenge of sustainable development can only be met with other countries.
It alone cannot stop the concentration of air pollutants in its Arctic area.
It can only stop the effects of {{sur}} {{acides}} on its lakes and forests, and it needs a stable and fair trade system to ensure its economic growth.
Similarly, Canada is affected by a number of ways by poverty, environmental {{environnementale,}} demographic growth and migration in the developing world.
For example, the demand for development aid is more strong and the number of refugees is increasing or commercial {{commerciaux}}
As far as sustainable international development is concerned, Canada is mainly aimed at promoting a set of rules and standards of {{exécutoire,}} as well as {{selon}} standards in the case of which all countries are {{tous}}
The elements of this package are sectoral or functional {{ressources}} resources {{changement}} climate change and trade, {{et}} and the definition of the links between them must be made in favour of institutional {{institutionnelles}}
In some cases, the rules and standards already exist in the form of international environmental conventions.
On the other hand, trade agreements, such as the Free Trade Agreement {{ou}} or the Uruguay Round {{comportent}} include environmental aspects.
A new Convention on desertification has been negotiated and {{et}} and Canada is preparing to apply it as soon as it enters into force.
In spite of this, there are shortcomings in particular with regard to forests and {{et}} and these are sectors which must be given priority in the immediate future.
This is a broad project and has achieved challenges and we need years and even decades to complete a coordinated framework in this area.
The environmental assessment of policies, programmes and projects remains a key instrument for promoting sustainable development.
Under the {{canadienne}} {{sur}} on environmental assessment, new initiatives carried out by our country in the context of its foreign policy, development aid and its international trade policy will be the subject of such an assessment, and the environmental effects of the projects financed by {{canadienne}} {{pour}} to know the economic, social and social consequences and the impact on health.
The {{est}} programme is one of the key mechanisms through which Canada promotes sustainable development in developing countries.
With this programme, Canada contributes directly to bilateral projects and to those NGOs which focus on sustainable development.
Our country supports the Global Environment Fund {{créé}} created in order to help developing countries to tackle environmental problems in the developing countries.
And it has been actively involved in making the multilateral institutions, including international financial institutions and the institutions {{à}} to pay more attention to the social and ecological dimensions of development.
In Rio Canada promised to honour the results of the {{et}} and to get it on.
The {{comprend}} understands that the world must make long-term changes in all areas of activity in order to protect the interests of future generations, and it is resolved to act in this direction to the country and together with other countries.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{de}} to make the bilateral institutions, regional and multilateral institutions more effective, forcing them to make them more aware and increase their ability to promote sustainable development.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Canada is working closely with a range of regional and international institutions.
This includes the United Nations, the World Bank, the {{(APEC),}} Economic Cooperation Mechanism {{l'Organisation}} the Organisation of Cooperation and Economic Development {{l'Organisation}} the Organisation of the American States {{et}} and the recent Organisation for the {{nord-américain}} Agreement on {{environnementale.}}
In addition, most multilateral development banks are also more active in promoting and supporting sustainable development through their lending programmes.
Canada is continuing this objective in the context of {{G-7.}}
Canada also supports a number of programmes and projects in developing countries - especially through {{et}} and the Research Centre on International Development {{--}} - in order to consolidate the institutional means needed to achieve the objectives of sustainable development.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{de}} to strengthen the links between trade and sustainable development through the World Trade Organisation.
The Committee is convinced that the adoption of clear international rules and standards will help to help the cause of sustainable development, and to reduce the current trend of certain countries to invoke the environmental argument to justify {{commercial.}}
International development of sustainable development has produced a series of useful principles to guide work in this area.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Discussions on trade and the environment are fundamental to ensuring that trade and environmental policies implemented in all countries promote sustainable development.
It is precisely about ensuring that trade policies do not contribute to the deterioration of the environment or that they do not restrict legitimate environmental programmes, and that environmental policies do not restrict trade.
The principles of the International Institute for Sustainable Development {{pourraient}} could be a useful reference framework for these important discussions.
The efforts of the {{pour}} to resolve the problems relating to trade and the environment by drawing up trade rules will continue to focus on the newly established Committee on Trade and the {{établi}}
In particular, this committee has a mandate to make recommendations on the changes to the multilateral trade system to increase the positive interaction between trade and environmental policies and to ensure that environmental programmes are not used for protectionist purposes.
This analysis is a better understanding of issues in question.
In addition to the work of the WTO, many of the issues of commercial and environmental nature will have to be dealt with by improved and comprehensive international cooperation, as well as the establishment of international standards.
The {{poursuivra}} will continue this objective in international organisations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Conference on Trade and Development {{l'OCDE}} the OECD and the International Trade Organisation {{l'OCDE}}
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{de}} to put in place mechanisms to ensure close coordination of national and international policies on sustainable development, including the {{de}} together with the interested parties, of consultation mechanisms for action.
The {{est}} is in agreement with this recommendation, and it is working with several {{fédérales,}} {{et}} and non-governmental bodies, through a consultative group on the Committee on Sustainable Development in the United Nations and other advisory advisory bodies, to make recommendations on matters such as forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human institutions and climate change.
Canada produces an annual report to the Commission for the sustainable development of the United Nations, which relates to all the issues covered by {{21}} 21 and on other recommendations arising from the {{CNUED.}}
Other mechanisms will be set up, according to needs, to examine specific issues.
For example, in May 1994, the {{a}} created a working group of the Advisory Committee on External Trade {{qui}} which gives advice on trade and environmental issues.
In the context of international aid, the International Development Agency {{mène}} has been conducting extensive consultations with Canadian speakers on its policies and programmes.
In the field of the environment, in particular, {{consulte}} {{chaque}} the Canadian NGOs concerned and the private sector, including the Association of {{canadiens.}} {{canadiens.}}
The {{continuera}} will continue to maintain close working relations with other {{de}} government and speakers such as companies, NGOs and specialised institutions in all Canada.
Within the framework of an {{visant}} initiative to harmonise the management of the environment in Canada, discussions are currently being carried out to draw up processes and mechanisms which will enable the provinces to be able to participate in the preparation, negotiation and application of new international environmental agreements.
Representatives of non-governmental groups will also continue to {{quand}} when possible, to special meetings and workshops and to be part of a part of delegations and to be part of the delegations and to be part of the delegations of {{gouvernementaux}}
- - As those who have seen the meetings of the UN sustainable development group - those of the intergovernmental working group on forests {{par}} by Canada and Malaysia, and the negotiations on climate change, biodiversity and desertification.
Thanks to such consultation, Canada will be able to harmonise its national and {{internationales;}} policies in the eyes of the {{cela}} it is necessary to ensure sustainable development.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
Let us give priority to the implementation of the strategy of environmental industries.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} should be given priority to the implementation of the strategy on environmental industries.
This {{approuvée}} approved in October 1994 is intended to increase the growth rate and exports of industry, while encouraging the achievement of the {{Gouvernement}} objectives, the environment and the establishment of a strong and competitive economy at international level.
The strategy will be implemented on four financial exercises and its programmes will be {{en}} in three major areas.

The main ministries and bodies involved in implementing the strategy are the following {{:}} {{l'Industrie,}} {{les}} natural {{naturelles,}} foreign affairs and international trade, and {{l'ACDI.}}
We put in place a consultative group on the environment industry for international trade.
training courses on the commercial use of environmental technologies will be organised to commercial {{commerciaux.}}
The collection of information on the markets will be improved and the expert group on the environment industries will be strengthened to speed up the dissemination of these information.
Finally, an update of the various {{et}} and data services of Canada is under way.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{de}} to continue the action plan on sustainable development adopted at the {{Terre,}} Summit in {{notamment}} in particular with regard to the application of existing environmental conventions and the conclusion of other agreements aimed at forests, fisheries and the {{circumpolaire.}} region.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} agrees with the Committee on the need to continue the action plan on sustainable development adopted at the {{à}} Summit in {{Rio.}}
Canada was the second country {{à}} to sign and ratify the Convention on Climate Change and the first {{à}} country to sign and ratify the Convention on Biological {{biologique.}}
The two conventions are now in force.
Canada has been actively involved in the negotiation and recent conclusion of the {{désertification.}} Convention.
Canada is now trying to ensure the effective application of the conventions on climate change and biological diversity and, when it comes into force and has been ratified by Canada, will do so with the new Convention on desertification.
Canada has also played an important role in the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and continues to ensure leadership in the ongoing discussions on updating and strengthening the {{Protocole.}}
In addition, {{le}} the Research Centre for International Development and the International Institute for Sustainable Development have drawn up very specific programmes to promote the achievement of the objectives set out in the {{21.}} {{21.}} programme.
The {{souscrit}} also endorses the recommendation of the Committee to grant priority to forests, fisheries and cooperation in {{circumpolaire.}}
{{:}} Canada has major interests and important responsibility for the protection of the long-term health of its forests.
In the last four years, in the absence of international forest management rules the producers of forestry products such as Canada have had problems to respond to increasing pressure by consumers in favour of forestry products from forests managed in a sustainable manner.
However, Canada is responding to these new challenges.
In the country, the federal and {{provinciaux}} governments are applying the {{sur}} {{directeurs}} on forests adopted in Rio through initiatives such as the national forestry strategy, the establishment of 10 {{modèles}} {{»}} in the {{(soit}} country, which are in line with the principles of {{durable),}} development and through codes of {{provinciaux.}}
At international level, Canada is seeking an agreement with the establishment of rules on sustainable forest management.
We would like to see these integrated rules into a International Convention on forests.
One of the efforts to {{le}} the necessary international consensus and {{le}} the Montreal process to draw up criteria and indicators for the sustainable management of tropical forests, {{--}} and {{--}} - committed by the holding of a workshop under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe {{(OSCE).}}
By means of the International {{vert,}} Partnership Programme of the Green Plan, Canada supports the establishment of {{en}} forests in Russia, Mexico and {{Malaisie.}}
Canada recently {{avec}} with Malaysia the Intergovernmental Working Group on forests, which is an international group of experts involving 32 governments, 10 non-governmental organisations and five international organisations.
The report by the working group has a wide range of options for international cooperation to renew global dialogue on forests and to make progress towards the sustainable management of forests throughout the world, including proposals for innovative approaches to mobilise the financial resources.
{{:}} fish stocks from the Atlantic Atlantic continue to be {{rapidement,}} even since the moratorium adopted by Canada and the Atlantic Fisheries Organisation {{(OPANO).}}
The impact on over 400 Atlantic communities is {{désastreuses.}}
It is clear that environmental factors have played an important role in this regard, even if this role is not yet understood.
Canada has taken drastic measures in its jurisdiction - the fishing area of 200 {{avec}} with 14 {{portant}} on almost all the major stocks of {{ayant}} fish with a commercial value.
In addition, we have adopted a law that allows ships flying the flag of convenience and ships to be {{pas}} from the national flag which fish in the Great Lakes {{Terre-Neuve,}} from outside our area of 200 {{en}} in {{des}} {{mesures}}
The new law has allowed the withdrawal of these vessels from this sector.
At international level, Canada {{ses}} its efforts to accept international fisheries management rules {{qui}} which include the recognition of the special interests of coastal states such as Canada with regard to {{chevauchant}} stocks, the limit of the {{exclusive.}} area.
These efforts have led to a certain extent and a draft convention was submitted to the UN 1994 Conference in August 1994 of the UN Conference on {{chevauchants}} {{chevauchants}} and {{stocks}} stocks.
The efforts of Canada in this year will be devoted to drawing up the final text.
There is also the answer to the {{:}} recommendation as well.
Canadian {{canadien}} is not just a fragile ecosystem but also a {{pour}} for atmospheric pollutants which are just as far as the southern {{Sud.}}
The people of the High North {{qui}} who are mainly {{sont}} are already affected by the phenomenon.
Reducing the dangers for the Arctic environment cannot be restricted to initiatives in the Arctic.
The efforts of Canada at international level with regard to climate change, large-scale transport of atmospheric pollutants and the dumping of radioactive waste are justified partly by the dangers of the Arctic environment.
Canada and the seven other {{circumpolaires}} nations - Denmark for Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and {{ont}} have signed a declaration on environmental protection and apply a Arctic environmental protection strategy.
Three indigenous groups, the {{inuit,}} Conference {{le}} the {{Council}} {{et}} and the Russian Association of the North {{du}} are involved as observers in all meetings on {{Stratégie.}}
Canada will receive the next ministerial meeting on {{en}} in 1996.
Canada is also working on the establishment of a {{arctique,}} Council with a view to creating a forum for the highest level of political attention on issues of {{circumpolaires.}}
The recent appointment of an ambassador for {{circumpolaires}} affairs shows the intention of the {{de}} to play a more important role in Canada on the {{de}} issues of consulting the relevant parties, particularly North governments and indigenous groups, and to give new impetus to the Canada action programme in the Arctic.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{de}} to ensure that the relevant foreign policies are assessed according to their possible repercussions on sustainable development.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Sustainable development must be fully integrated into the environmental, economic and social dimensions including the political and political dimensions.
Any particular question of foreign policy must take into account each of these aspects.
With regard to the environmental dimension of sustainable development, the {{accorde}} environmental management plan gives priority to environmental assessments of policies and programmes.
The new initiatives proposed by the {{sont}} are examined in order to assess the possible impact on the environment.
The officials who submit programmes or policies to ministers must apply the {{sur}} guidelines on the evaluation of policies and programmes.
In recent years, the {{a}} has examined the content of {{et}} {{et}} and the Uruguay Round agreements.
This experience, combined with the commitment of the {{à}} to apply the principles of sustainable development to its common management, is a solid basis for responding to future requirements for assessing environmental effects, in terms of the new {{canadienne}} {{sur}} on environmental assessment.
The Canadian Development Assistance Programme {{a}} is intended to support sustainable development in developing countries.
Under its sustainable environmental policy, {{se}} must assess the effects on the environment of its policies and programmes.
The {{l'ACDI}} {{et}} and the Federal Office of review of environmental assessments have worked together to prepare a special regulatory procedure for {{à}} the projects outside Canada in terms of the new {{canadienne}} {{sur}} on environmental assessment.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the foreign policy of Canada must remain proactive in sustainable development.
In particular, it recommends {{:}}
{{d'établir}} to establish links between sustainable development, poverty, democracy and the good government.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
A growing international consensus to recognise that only an integrated strategy taking into account the fundamental reports between economic, environmental and social dimensions including the {{des}} aspects of the human authorities will enable sustainable sustainable development.
The {{cherchera}} will seek to deal with sustainable development issues, particularly by examining links with key issues of key issues.
{{le}} international crime, the rights of the person and democratisation, relations with developing countries - with regard to poverty, the good government and {{la}} conflict prevention and the consolidation of peace after conflicts.
As mentioned in the answer to the recommendation {{un}} a office which will take place on the management of global challenges will be created in {{MAECI;}}
It will work closely with many other state bodies, including the ministries of {{de}} {{l'Environnement,}} {{la}} and {{et}} and {{Justice.}}
The framework for the sustainable development of {{prend}} takes into account environmental sustainability, as well as the rights of the individual, democratic development, the good government and the fight against poverty.
{{continuera}} will continue to ensure that these aspects of the {{sont}} foreign policy are taken into account in the drafting of its strategic planning documents, projects and programmes.
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that Canada ratify {{plus}} III without delay.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
During the debate on foreign policy in March, the Foreign Minister announced that Canada will soon be {{bientôt}} the Convention.
The {{examine}} looks at the laws of the country, to make them comply with the provisions of the Convention in order to achieve ratification.
The Committee recommends that Canada continues to participate actively in the work of the Atlantic Atlantic Fisheries Organisation {{et}} and it is trying to increase efficiency.
{{Le}} Canada was among the main speakers in the movement that led to the creation of {{après}} after the limit of national fishing areas had been extended to 200 {{milles.}}
Since then, it is actively involved in every {{l'Organisation.}} activity.
In fact, Canada believes that such a regional body is essential to ensure the proper exploitation and conservation of fish stocks just beyond its own exclusive fishing area.
Canada is determined to demand the adoption of better operational and institutional mechanisms, so as to increase the results and {{l'utilité.}}
The Convention which is drawing up the United Nations Conference on fish stocks {{et}} and the stocks of large {{misera}} {{très}} very likely on regional bodies such as {{pour}} to ensure that fishing is {{des}}
The committee suggests that technical cooperation on the management of the oceans is an important component of aid aid.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} shares the opinion of the committee that Canada can play an important role in helping developing countries to manage the marine resources.
In its revised development aid policy, the {{a}} has made the environment a priority.
Technical cooperation for the management of the oceans will be a particular element of this priority area.
{{Nous}} we recommend the government to work urgently with other states to form a Arctic Council, one of the priorities would be to remove the dangers that threaten the Arctic environment.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} must be created as a matter of urgency to create a Arctic Council, which would be part of the governments of eight countries {{par}} by this {{à}} namely Canada, Denmark {{la}} Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.
Canada is considering the Council as a {{qui}} which {{les}} the existing organisations and initiatives in the Arctic.
{{est}} participation is essential to the success of the Council.
It should be concerned with sustainable development in the Arctic and integrate the economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects to its mandate.
The new ambassador on {{circumpolaires,}} {{circumpolaires,}} Mrs {{Simon,}} {{les}} discussions and consultations with the seven other Arctic countries, as well as with the people of the North, to establish a Arctic Council.
{{5:}} {{Renouveler}} {{l'aide}} aid
The Committee says that the aim of the Canadian development aid programme must be the primary objective of reducing poverty by means of effective action to the poorest people in the countries that are most in need of our assistance and which can take advantage of it.
The Committee recommends that the Canadian aid programme should be used for sustainable development as a fundamental policy framework for the development of human potential.
{{Le}} the {{est}} agrees with the importance that the committee is about reducing poverty and sustainable development.
We also believe that the efforts made to clarify the mandate of the Canadian Development aid programme must be based on the growing diversity between developing countries.
We also recognise that there is no single way to alleviate poverty, and that we must use several programmes and policies in an integrated way.
The {{a}} recently prepared a policy of policy on reducing poverty which will guide the programming of the six priorities of public development aid for the development of {{(voir}} {{la}} (see the answer to the {{pour}} recommendation for a more {{cela}} explanation that is to tackle the fundamental causes and structural factors of poverty.
This document was made public.
The {{croit}} believes that the objectives relating to poverty relief and sustainable development can be combined in {{d'objectif}} {{suivant}}
The aim of the Canadian development aid programme is to support sustainable development in developing countries, in order to reduce poverty and make the world safer and fairer and more {{prospère.}}
In relation to the current share of less than 20 {{100}} 100 % of {{le}} the committee recommends that the key needs are at least 25 {{100}} 100 {{l'APD.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
{{en}} for fundamental human needs will become one of the key priorities of the {{Canada.}} {{Canada.}} programme.
Aid will be provided in the following areas: health care, basic education, family planning, {{qualité}} water quality and housing quality.
Canada will continue to ensure humanitarian aid in emergency situations.
The {{est}} is determined to increase the support given to the satisfaction of the essential needs, and it will affect 25 {{de}} of {{à}} to this priority.
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that official aid to the development of Canada on six {{:}}
The needs of {{les}} the rights of {{la}} sound public management and {{démocratique;}} development, participation of {{la}} the preservation of the environment, the development of the {{et}} sector, and public participation.
{{Le}} the {{accepte}} accepts the first five priorities recommended by the {{Comité.}}
Therefore, public aid will focus on development {{concentrera}}
The fundamental human needs in order to support efforts in the areas of health care of basic education, family planning, food, water, hygiene and housing, and in order to provide humanitarian aid in emergency situations.
Women and development, in order to encourage the full participation of women, for the sustainable development of their societies.
The rights of the individual, democracy and the good government, in order to increase respect for the rights of the individual, including the children, to promote democracy and better management of public affairs, and to strengthen civil society.
The development of the private sector, in order to promote sustained and fair economic growth by supporting the private sector in developing countries.
{{afin}} to help developing countries protect their physical environment and contribute to the management of environmental challenges at regional and global level.
The participation of the public is undoubtedly of key importance, but it is {{distincte,}} and it must be dealt with differently.
The {{estime}} believes that public participation is an integral part of the other priority programmes and must be taken into account in parallel with measures to step up consultation and communication.
Canada has a great deal to offer to help developing countries to provide {{écosympathiques}} infrastructure services - for example, in the field of electricity in rural areas and communications - by highlighting the poorest groups and the construction of capacity.
Therefore, the {{pense}} believes that infrastructure services must also be a priority for the {{l'APD.}} programme.
The infrastructure services are essential for economic growth and the development of human beings.
This is an area which is well in line with the competences and experience of Canada.
{{s'assurera}} {{que}} that detailed policies are set up for each of the six priorities of its programme.
{{Le}} the committee recommends that the parliament adopt a law laying down the fundamental principles of public development aid to {{(APD).}}
The committee recommends that the Standing Committee of the House of Commons on Foreign Affairs and International Trade or the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the {{des}} Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs try to take part in the most possible {{possible.}}
The report by the committee states that these recommendations are intended to make it clear to the role of {{et}} and to finally set the objectives, in order to ensure better {{et}} and greater transparency and to give Parliament a more important role.
The {{souscrit}} agrees with the recommendations.
However, by adopting a law on {{le}} the {{ne}} does not necessarily encourage the achievement of the {{ci-haut}} objectives and it would damage the implementation of programmes by reducing flexibility.
{{démarche}} could also restrict the range of measures that could have to be taken to deal with the rapid development conditions in developing countries.
The {{n'exclut}} does not exclude the possibility of adopting a law on {{dans}} in the future.
At the moment, however, it will take the following measures to follow the two recommendations which {{:}}
{{d'objectifs}} objectives and six priorities for the programme mentioned in the {{de}} foreign policy policy establish a clear mandate and specific objectives for the {{l'APD.}} programme.
The {{est}} agrees that the parliament plays a greater role in examining public development aid, which could include regular analyses of the results of {{l'ACDI.}}
As for the concerns of {{et}} and transparency, both in both the Parliament and the public, they will be in part in the framework of {{de}} III of the general budget expenditure.
It will then be a question of establishing clearer objectives for the programmes and projects, to clarify realistic expectations with regard to the results and regularly producing progress reports for the competent committees of the parliament, Canada and public partners.
Efforts are already being made to improve the review of performance and management functions.
The Committee recommends that there should be a transfer of the role of {{que}} which is based primarily on the promotion of trade in bodies which are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade {{la}} the company for the expansion of export exports.
{{Il}} it would be appropriate for the private sector for the promotion of the private sector to promote {{nous}} we recommend that trade relations with Canada.
{{Le}} the {{accepte}} accepts these recommendations and is resolved to focus on development in the activities that {{mène}} leads to the private sector.
We share the opinion of the committee that measures to intensify trade in the Third World can have a very positive influence on development.
We believe that the private sector in Canada is an important partner of {{au}} in the development chapter and, in view of the emphasis placed on it, we will try to promote long-term reports between the Canadian private sector and the developing countries, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and the transfer of technology.
In this context, {{prépare}} is currently preparing a detailed policy on the development of the private sector.
The {{(PCI)}} industrial cooperation programme {{l'ACDI}} provides the private sector in Canada a unique opportunity to contribute to reducing poverty and sustainable development.
The participation of Canadian companies has a significant impact on the private sector in developing countries.
In addition, this programme is well known by these countries, as well as the other donors and international bodies.
The {{prendra}} will take action to make more emphasis on development in the {{l'ACDI}} {{l'ACDI}} and to ensure better coordination between {{la}} {{et}} and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Trade {{du}}
To this end, those responsible for the {{devront}} will have to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the {{au}} at the level of each project.
{{Le}} the Committee states that it is not in the mandate of the {{de}} to promote Canadian exports even if there are circumstances where the aid and trade objectives are complementary.
It recommends that more aid should be made with other donors.
More specifically, the government should work within the OECD Development Committee in order to reduce the percentage of aid linked to 20 {{100}} 100 by the year 2000.
The {{croit}} believes that the partnerships with the private sector supported by {{doivent}} must promote sustainable development in developing countries.
{{et}} and Canadian industry have much to offer developing countries.
The Canadian development aid programme has been {{de}} of goods and services from our country.
The {{estime}} believes that the current guidelines for {{l'aide,}} aid if they are properly applied, provide sufficient flexibility in {{et}} and do not harm the effectiveness of programmes.
The provisions relating to aid aid contribute to establishing relations in Canada and developing countries.
In this context, {{est}} is aware of the need to ensure that Canadian goods and services meet the needs of {{et}} and that their prices are {{concurrentiels.}}
Canada has long been involved in international discussions on the aid and related issues {{dépendance}} dependence on aid, cooperation {{technique).}}
It is committed to working closely with the OECD Development Committee and other mechanisms to ensure the effective use of resources of resources.
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that {{lorsqu'elle}} when it supports structural adjustment programmes, gives particular attention to the effects on the poor and the measures taken to protect vulnerable groups.
The {{devrait}} should also extend its own conditionality in order to aim to reduce excessive military expenditure and greater transparency in military operations.
{{devrait}} should also stress a review of structural adjustment programmes so that poverty reduction becomes a central objective of development.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
It also believes that other measures are needed to improve structural adjustment programmes, to extend conditionality and promote transparency.
The {{collaborera}} {{avec}} with international organisations, developing countries and the groups affected to ensure that the structural adjustment programmes also include the following objectives, {{de}} poverty, environmental protection and the rights of the individual, and the promotion of equality between men and women.
{{continuera,}} {{comme}} as she has been doing for a long time, to help vulnerable groups in their efforts to mitigate the effects of structural {{structurel.}}
The excessive military budgets are damaging to development, because they are using resources that would otherwise make it possible to achieve social objectives.
In cooperation with other donor countries, Canada will look at collective actions that can change expenditure practices.
Transparency is an essential aspect of the good government.
The {{poursuivra}} will continue its dialogue and technical cooperation on these issues.
The Committee states that respect for the rights of the individual, the good government and democratic development are universal values that must be central to the foreign policy of Canada and influence and guide other policies.
Canada must seek to promote respect for these values at international level by various means, including dialogue and cooperation programmes.
As regards the countries whose governments are committing serious violations of the rights of the individual, Canada should work with other countries to bring about a change of behaviour and need Canada to go to the cancellation of bilateral aid.
In these cases, however, it should continue to help the poor and vulnerable groups through non-governmental organisations.
{{Le}} the {{est}} agrees that the rights of the individual, the good government and democratic development are universal values that must occupy a central role in the foreign policy of Canada and also the answer to the recommendation to be {{3.7).}}
The {{réaffirme}} thus reaffirms its commitment to the International Centre on Human Rights and democratic development.
This Centre will continue to play a leading role in achieving the {{canadiens.}} objectives.
The {{considère}} considers respect for the rights of the person not only as a fundamental value, but also as a crucial element in the development of democratic and democratic societies living in peace with each other.
The great challenge is to decide the best ways of bringing governments to respect fundamental human rights.
Our ultimate objective is not to punish countries and innocent people whose governments violate rights, but rather to change behaviour and encourage governments to respect the rights of their people.
The answer to a particular situation requires the {{de}} mix of various factors, and above all the effectiveness of the resources available to us.
The efforts that Canada is making to defend the rights of the person are based on various means, including dialogue and consultation in the multilateral {{multilatérales.}}
Development aid is a constructive way of resolving the issues relating to the rights of the individual, democracy and public management.
As one of the six priorities for {{l'aide}} aid in this area of {{par}} for example, the initiatives for restoring peace and reconciliation, education in the field of human rights, the extension of access to legal redress and the strengthening of {{et}} and justice systems and other representatives of civil society to participate fully and effectively in the decision-making process in their countries.
Canada will continue to work with various partners, including governments, NGOs and multilateral organisations, in order to promote our objectives.
The {{pourrait}} could use special measures on aid and trade if there are systematic and persistent violations of international rights of human rights.
For example, {{ne}} aid must not reward or give the impression to reward such behaviour from the governments.
In various ways, such as the committee has been mentioned.
The {{examinera}} will examine its actions in the case of case.
Canada will maintain its leadership on the rights of the UN in the UN, the OSCE, the {{de}} of {{et}} and {{l'OEA.}}
Canada has contributed to establishing the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, whose mandate includes the promotion and protection of the rights of the individual and the prevention of human rights violations which would {{un}} a conflict, and coordination of the activities of the {{touchant}} system affecting the rights of the individual.
These bodies often offer the most effective way of influencing governments.
In the international financial institutions {{et}} and various donor groups, Canada will also stress the need to examine the commitment of beneficiaries to the good government.
In particular, Canada {{la}} the consultation with others in order to influence the countries that spend a lot in the purchase of arms rather than promoting education and education programmes for their population.
{{Le}} the Committee believes that the support of Canada continues to be too {{et}} and it recommends that more public aid should be focused on developing development in less countries, taking into account the primary objective of the {{l'APD.}}
Canada should maintain its current high level of {{allouée}} allocated to Africa, review the share of other regions, and work closely with other donors to ensure better coordination and complementarity of international aid as a whole.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} should be made more effective by focusing on a more limited number of priorities, by focusing better on the beneficiaries, and by better coordinating the aid projects.
However, Canada has important interests in all parts of the world.
The {{estime}} believes that a large proportion of {{à}} should be allocated to a limited number of countries, while continuing to carry out the programmes in other countries through {{coûteux}} and simple mechanisms.
The {{convient}} has to continue to receive the most important part of the {{l'APD.}}
It will regularly examine the distribution of aid between regions.
Canada will continue to play a leading role in the OECD and other {{ainsi}} groups, so that the other donor countries can improve coordination and cohesion of development aid.
The {{prendra}} will take action to strengthen consultations with its Canadian partners in the field of development and to ensure greater coordination of the various instruments of foreign policy that affect development.
The Committee recommends that Canada will continue to carry out active programmes for aid to the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Europe and those of the former Soviet Union.
In addition, it recommends that the funding of these programmes will not {{les}} the priorities of the {{énoncées}} {{plus}}
{{Le}} the {{est}} is in agreement, Canada will continue to have active programmes of aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{et}} and those of the former Soviet Union {{et}} and {{que}} that these programmes are not financed at the expense of the priorities of the {{l'APD.}}
It is important for Canada to ensure that the transformation of the region is {{de}}
The creation of open and prosperous market savings will create important trade and investment, which will directly benefit the {{canadienne.}} economy.
Furthermore, the integration of these economies to the economic and global system will help ensure prosperity throughout the world and benefit all.
Finally, the promotion and maintenance of stability in the region directly contribute to improving security and international stability.
The {{recourt}} aid programme uses various {{pour}} to react quickly to the development of regional {{régionales}} and the interests of {{canadiens.}}
The most often possible Canadian partners have projects.
On the other hand, projects are also developing on the basis of the initiatives of the {{et}} and the demands made by the governments concerned.
In both cases, the implementation of the programmes is based on {{les}} projects are being implemented by the private sector {{les}} companies and commercial associations, NGOs, educational institutions, ethnic groups, and all the {{de}} of government.
The federal funds {{le}} the {{leur}} their payment encourages partners to Canada and in the recipient countries to make important contributions and which leads to a much wider programme than the Federal Government could achieve it alone.
In order to maximise efficiency, a reorganisation of roles between the {{qui}} which is currently {{actuellement}} the programme, and {{aura}} will take place.
The {{retiendra}} will be responsible for drawing up policies when {{assumera}} will take responsibility for the implementation of the programme.
This new function for {{cadre}} well with its activities elsewhere in the world.
close coordination between the two organisations will ensure the continued development and implementation of the programme.
The Committee recommends that Canada continues to respond to emergency {{d'urgence,}} but it sets out {{de}} criteria so that long-term development aid remains the primary task of the aid programme.
{{Le}} the provision of emergency aid must be {{la}}
In its opinion, it will try to prevent emergency situations, to be ready to face it, and to provide essential support for health, food, housing and other {{aux}} to the victims of crises.
Canada will also help refugees and displaced persons to {{car}} because it is the first essential step in the direction of {{et}} and the recovery of development.
The long-term development aid will remain the main subject of the {{d'APD.}} programme.
The Committee recommends to maintain and even {{la}} the share of the funds allocated to partnership programmes, or the partners have shown their effectiveness and their {{efficience.}}
{{doit}} must also take into account the support of its partners in Canada and we can measure in particular the participation of volunteers working for the organisation in question and the ability to collect additional contributions to those of {{l'ACDI.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} recognises that Canadian partners can play an important role in the development of policies, as well as in planning and implementation of the Canadian development aid programmes.
However, any decision on the size of {{aux}} benefits to the partner NGOs must take into account the serious budgetary constraints that {{et}} and {{sont}} are facing.
{{sera}} will be given to partners that show the most effective and offer programmes that complement those of the government by supporting sustainable development.
In addition, special attention will be given to partners who can provide their own financial contributions and the contribution of volunteers or for young people to be used abroad.
{{Le}} the committee recommends that the government is committed to stabilising the {{l'APD}} ratio to gross national product {{à}} and that it is trying to make it {{à}} 100 when the financial situation of Canada {{permettra.}}
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} maintains its commitment to an active and effective programme of public aid to development in the foreign policy of Canada.
In view of the current financial context, all government programmes are {{et}} and the {{ne}} programme is no exception.
The {{est}} is determined to move closer to the target of {{p.}} 100 when the financial situation of Canada {{permettra.}}
{{Comme}} as the expansion of trade is more important than aid for many developing countries, the committee also recommends that the government is planning to open up the Canadian market to developing countries, particularly to the least developed countries.
{{Tout}} just like the {{le}} the {{accorde}} gives great importance to open trade systems in order to promote development.
The {{est}} economy is very open and the trade commitments that the country has taken during the Uruguay Round will have to {{encore}} even more.
Under the Uruguay Round agreements, Canada has agreed to eliminate customs tariffs in key sectors and to reduce the other of 40 {{100}} 100 per {{moyenne.}}
Canada applies a {{appelé}} {{préférentiel,}} called the general preference for certain imports from most developing countries.
The {{est}} is looking at all the {{du}} of the {{pour}} to identify the possibilities of reducing them and apply them to a range of more {{il}} products, so it aims to provide additional benefits to the least developed countries, without losing sight of the possible consequences for the industries concerned.
As far as non-tariff barriers are concerned, the Uruguay Round agreements indicate that the system of own quotas in {{multifibres}} {{(qui}} {{vise}} is aimed at textiles and clothing imported from countries in {{disparaîtra}} will disappear at the end of ten years.
Subsequently, the tariffs will be the only protection for this sector, and it is a reduction in the commitments made during the Uruguay Round.
In addition, Canada will seek to provide technical assistance to help developing countries to participate effectively in the new trade agreements {{que}} {{l'ALENA}} and {{concernant}}
The Committee recommends broader consultations on development cooperation, which will involve the Members of Parliament.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
Many Canadian and foreign partners play a vital role in the {{Canada.}} {{Canada.}} programme.
Their contribution is essential to provide skills, knowledge and resources to meet the many challenges of development.
In order to be effective, development aid must be a collective task, which requires sharing of information and consultation.
Various consultations are held every year with the {{l'ACDI,}} partners, including NGOs in development, trade associations, universities and schools and environmental groups.
A timetable for consultations is published on a regular basis.
The {{cherchera}} will seek to improve its consultation process on development cooperation.
This will include the forthcoming meetings of the National Forum on International Relations in Canada.
{{6:}} {{Promouvoir}} promotion of culture and Canadian knowledge abroad
The committee strongly recommends that international cultural affairs, scientific and international affairs, be treated as a fundamental dimension of the foreign policy of Canada.
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that the government of Canada, together with the provinces of the {{intéressées,}} is a priority for the development of a strategy on cultural, scientific and {{éducationnelles}} relations.
This strategy could use regulation and other means, such as joint companies with the private sector, to support the production of Canadian cultural products and their distribution in Canada and abroad.
It should take into account the special circumstances and specific proposals to each of the major cultural industries, namely {{la}} {{les}} sport, sport, television and the {{et}} and concrete proposals contained in John {{Saul}} {{et}} report and the report by Mrs {{Joyal.}} {{Joyal.}}
Once {{la}} the strategy should be {{aux}} to the permanent parliamentary committees responsible for foreign affairs.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
We are determined that cultural, scientific and educational relations remain key elements in the foreign relations of Canada.
In the period of globalisation of the economy, when companies are increasingly affected by the international economy and the pressure it {{le}} the role of culture, as a {{prend}} force is of vital importance.
At the same time, while {{(s'exprimant}} under the forms of technology, organisations and {{devient}} is becoming a key element in competitiveness on the world stage, education has a key role in promoting prosperity.
Canada benefits without {{pareil.}}
Its culture is very diverse and is characterised by excellence and dynamism throughout the world, it contributes to giving all the {{un}} a sense of common identity.
Furthermore, our education institutions are among the best in the world and are increasingly aware of the fact that they increase the competitiveness of the country on the international stage, as research centres, innovation and knowledge.
The {{a}} intends to support both sectors in the most effective and efficient way.
The country's foreign policy must be {{:}}
Is Canada a leader in the new global economy, {{l'image}} the image of a single country, {{innovateur}} innovative and so {{compétitif;}}
protect our sovereignty of {{culturelle;}}
Let us highlight the {{en}} identity by showing its most creative aspects on the {{internationale;}} stage.
{{la}} growth and the vitality of culture and education sectors and thus contribute to creating jobs.
In this spirit, the {{croit}} believes that all aspects of the various cultures in Canada.
In last year, it has also taken a number of measures to increase the cultural presence of Canada abroad and to market cultural products on the international stage.
Recently, the {{a}} {{:}}

This is the support programme for the development aid programme {{le}} the support of the international marketing aid programme for the {{et}} industry and the {{»}} {{«}} of the aid programme for the distribution of {{publications.}}
In future, cultural activities with an international dimension will play a more central place in the management of foreign and business policy.
In the first instance, the European {{du}} {{du}} Office of the {{dont}} whose last government was to eliminate the functions, was strengthened and will now be under the High Minister responsible for the {{globaux.}}
Other measures are envisaged to develop this critical dimension of foreign policy.
The {{collaborera}} {{avec}} with the Canadian {{canadien}} Ministry and the cultural bodies in drawing up policies at federal level.
This action will take account of the views expressed by witnesses to the special Joint Committee and the many useful suggestions made in the {{Comité.}} report.
Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs will be {{consultés.}}
{{Le}} the committee also recommends that the foreign policy of Canada affects cultural, scientific and {{vise}}
Let us say the cultural sovereignty of Canada.
{{Comme}} as we suggested in the field on trade, the Government of Canada must take advantage of the exemptions made in the framework of {{et}} and {{aux}} to cultural industries in order to adopt regulatory and other measures to protect and promote cultural industries in order to protect and promote cultural industries.
In the forthcoming international negotiations, the government will have to seek alliances to ensure that the need to protect and promote national cultures.
The answer to the recommendation to the recommendation is {{la}}
The {{est}} is in agreement.
In order to maintain its identity and {{le}} Canada must preserve in the cultural area of {{une}} a position of choice.
The {{continuera}} will continue to work closely with countries that share their views and recognise the need to protect and promote their national identity and cultural values.
In the {{et}} and the {{Amériques,}} Summit in {{le}} Canada has brought all the participants involved to recognise that governments have an important role to play in promoting the diversity of content, including cultural and linguistic diversity, in the new European information society.
Canada is negotiating with the Council of Europe with an enlarged understanding that would allow it to participate fully in all the activities of the Council which relate to culture and cultural heritage.
Canada has also given a mechanism to keep annual consultations with the EU on cultural issues.
The participation of Canada to the cultural activities of the {{et}} and the {{lui}} also allows it to strengthen its relations with the countries with its opinions.
The {{a}} obtained exemptions for cultural industries, within the WTO and in the context of {{et}} and {{quand}} when it {{fallu.}}
{{Le}} the committee also recommends that the foreign policy of Canada affects cultural, scientific and {{vise}}
Let us help Canada become an important {{important}} in the global economy geared to knowledge.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
The involvement of Canada to the global economy of high knowledge is not just about foreign policy.
It also involves the intervention of other {{gouvernement,}} government, the private sector, higher education institutions, NGOs and other speakers.
The {{a}} recently published an action plan at government level, {{L'innovation}} {{:}} the key to the modern economy, which focuses on four areas of {{interdépendants}}
There is a more {{solide;}} market.

building a infrastructure infrastructure.
The technology - {{ne}} does not lose the ground.
In order to put in place a more {{le}} economy, the {{a}} in particular intends to transform the existing telephone {{de}} {{et}} and computers to make a more integrated system, the information {{de}}
Our infrastructure and the current information networks would soon be insufficient without rapid change, because the United States and Japan have launched extensive programmes to build their {{électroniques.}}
{{adoptera}} will adopt a series of policies and programmes to encourage manufacturers and users of the electronic {{électronique.}}
One of the elements of this strategy is to give {{accès}} access to competitive services on mobile {{mobiles,}} global and regional satellite services, which will enable them to use telecommunications without {{(téléphones}} {{téléchasseurs,}} {{radiodiffusion).}}
This will prepare the arrival of new services which call for {{tels}} signals such as digital broadcasting {{de}} personal communications and mobile satellites and {{sans}} without {{fil.}}
The {{compte}} also {{aussi}} the Canadian network for the progress of research, industry and education.
It will help to carry out its business plan to speed up its business plan to speed up the development of key elements of the electronic {{électronique,}} a {{ultra-rapide}} {{ultra-rapide}} network to test the technologies made in {{et}} and to increase the speed and scope of the Internet network.
Another element of the strategy is to extend the {{projet}} {{fédéral-provincial-territorial}} {{fédéral-provincial-territorial}} the {{devant}} project before the electronic {{électronique,}} schools, libraries and the European institutions, universities and hospitals in Canada.
Even if science is made in Canada, many of the new technologies which our industry needs come from abroad.
The {{cherchera}} will therefore seek to {{:}}
The acquisition of the industry in all the latest technologies is {{l'acquisition}}
The awareness of possible foreign partners and investors in capital risks the Canadian powers in {{S-T;}}

The {{encouragera}} will also encourage the links between Canadian and educational institutions and their {{à}} to {{l'étranger;}}
There are scientists in science and technology in some major tasks of Canada abroad to promote trade and cooperation in science and {{technologie;}}
And a network that could understand up to ten educational centres will be established by five years in {{pour}} to promote the Canadian institutions of Canadian institutions.
{{Le}} the committee also recommends that the foreign policy of Canada affects cultural, scientific and {{vise}}
{{Contribuer}} {{à}} to the vitality of arts and higher education.
Let us promote the export of cultural and cultural products in Canada.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
International activities are essential to the vitality of the arts and higher education.
In its programme of international cultural relations, the {{offre}} offers financial support for the artists and Canadian {{canadiens}} to enable them to achieve international standards of excellence and to highlight the achievements of our country on the world stage.
{{la}} the sale of products, services and powers of Canada in the field of culture, heritage and education is an integral part of the trade promotion programme.
The {{accorde}} gives priority to cultural industries and, while helping exporters of these products to participate in {{et}} and commercial missions to be {{il}} it will continue to support the {{canadienne}} industry strategy in the field of {{co-réalisations}} with foreign partners.
The {{collabore}} work more and more closely with the cultural industry {{pour}} to improve the opportunities in the United States and elsewhere abroad.
The {{soutient}} already supports production {{l'entremise}} by the Council of {{et}} and {{canadiens,}} {{canadiens,}} in a number of programmes.
As Canadian and educational products are characterised by their {{il}} it is important to invest in our creativity more than ever before.
That is why it is possible for the {{vont}} cultural and educational industries to continue to grow twice as much as the rest of the Canadian labour market.
{{Le}} the committee also recommends that the foreign policy of Canada affects cultural, scientific and {{vise}}
{{faciliter}} the transfer of knowledge.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
The efforts to promote the liberalisation of trade and investment and to conclude cultural, scientific and technological agreements contribute to achieving this objective.
The {{consulte}} is actively consulting the provinces and the private sector to adapt its programmes and methods in the global context of constant development, and to find opportunities to improve trade in the field of information and in research and development, so as to increase its competitiveness.
The {{cherchera}} will seek ways of improving its results in this respect, together with the {{provinces.}}
{{Le}} the Committee encourages the government to ask the {{de}} provinces to cooperate in the implementation of the cultural, scientific and {{éducationnel}} dimension of foreign policy by effective use of mechanisms such as the {{fédéral-provincial}} Advisory Committee on international activities related to education.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} is in agreement.
It will work together with other {{de}} of government in all areas of mutual interest.
The federal system has shown a remarkable flexibility when it has acted to follow the changes necessary to manage {{dans}} relations in the international context, as has been said recently by the {{«}} {{Canada}} {{Canada}} {{Canada}}
Similarly, the {{qu'occupent}} position and {{dans}} in the {{est}} is an asset for the foreign policy of Canada and also demonstrates the flexibility of the {{fédéralisme.}}
As far as the consultation mechanisms are concerned, the {{s'entretient}} {{régulièrement}} regularly with the higher authorities of the provinces {{exemple,}} for example, in the {{des}} conferences of the first {{ministres).}}
The {{renouvellera}} {{son}} its memorandum of understanding with the Council of Ministers of {{protocole}} Protocol which defines the framework of continuous consultations in the field of higher education at international level.
Other {{telles}} such as the {{des}} of Ministers responsible for Culture and historical {{historiques}} and the {{du}} Committee of Sport, look at the priorities in their own areas of responsibility.
As far as support for Canadian artists is concerned, the {{coordonne}} is coordinating its efforts with those of the {{par}} by means of representatives with {{permanents;}} reports, all the provinces are called upon to take part in bilateral cultural consultations that are official as an official one.
The {{est}} is prepared to examine other mechanisms for cooperation and consultation with all the {{provinces.}}
{{Le}} the Committee recommends that the Government of Canada is seriously considering the possibility of creating grants and exchange programmes which make a contribution to the private sector in an important way, so that Canadian students can make {{mais}} but significant {{des}} in higher education centres abroad outside the United States and European countries.
And that students from these other countries can do the same to Canada.
It would be useful for those responsible for these programmes to be informed of what their old students are {{leurs}}
The government agrees that the competitiveness of Canada in a global economy based on knowledge will depend largely on the ability of the next generation to develop knowledge and skills to deal with the other cultures and develop with {{dans}} in foreign {{étrangers.}}
To this end, Canada is managing the government for the government of Canada on the basis of reciprocity with Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Mexico.
In addition, the {{a}} programme programme and the {{du}} of the {{a}} saw the day after an initiative of Canada more than 30 years ago.
Canada continues to offer more prices within the framework of this programme than most of the other countries of the {{sans}} and the {{sont}} are also beneficiaries of more than 120 {{du}}
Last year the government has also renewed the academic exchange programme {{qui}} which gives rise to 20 exchanges every year.
However, we must do more.
That is why the government, a strong cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the development of human resources, is currently negotiating with the European Union with the establishment of a programme of cooperation in the field of education which will take place and universities and those who are trying to reduce some of the obstacles to mobility at university level.
The programme is designed so as to ensure the participation of European countries that would allow the traditional destinations to be extended to the university and France.
On the other hand, Canada is in favour of greater cooperation in North America in the field of higher education, research and training, and it has already begun to negotiate with Mexico and the United States a programme which will promote the mobility of students between the three countries.
Finally, we are working for Canada to be able to participate in the next two years in the {{des}} mobility programme in {{l'Asie-Pacifique.}}
In addition to the {{les}} {{dans}} in the global economic situation, these {{sont}} programmes are also a fundamental means of making the future foreign leaders aware of all the things that the Canadian market has {{perfectionné}}
The {{essaie}} is also trying to {{les}} the old of the {{Canada.}} government {{du}}
A study was carried out a few years ago in the case of the {{bourses}} {{d'études}} and {{du}} {{d'études}}
We will look at the possibility of permanent monitoring for foreign university university {{au}} in Canada in such programmes to strengthen relations with the old ones.
The committee would like to encourage universities and Canadian {{canadiens}} who receive a sufficiently large number of foreign students to follow a common practice, in other countries, to maintain relations with these students when they come home to them and to encourage them regularly to train groups in their countries and to find new ways of keeping contact with them.
Many Canadian {{canadiennes}} have already recognised the importance of permanent contact with their former foreign students and take effective action in this direction.
For its part, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is paying attention to the {{des}} Association and {{du}} Association Association Association Association of Canada and the Canadian Office of International Education on the recommendations of the Committee so that they can spread them to their members.
In addition, the {{aura}} will have other opportunities to encourage Canadian universities and {{canadiens}} to monitor this recommendation.
{{à}} missions abroad will help universities and {{dans}} in this company as far as possible.
The committee also recommends that the government is trying to promote cultural development in Canada by increasing the support offered to artists and creative intellectuals and by drawing up the necessary resources to ensure the distribution of the {{de}} of the latter in Canada and abroad.
The government agrees with this.
The vitality of the cultural and artistic community of Canada depends largely on access to the international stage and the success that it {{remporte.}}
In this respect, the government recognises that it must play a leading role in supporting cultural industries and the international educational services of Canada.
As far as the latter is concerned, Canadian educational {{éducatifs}} already exist in {{et}} and {{Séoul.}}
In view of the remarkable success of these {{le}} the government has announced its intention to open up others in Malaysia, China, Indonesia, {{Nam,}} Thailand in Singapore, Singapore and Hong Kong, the Philippines and, according to the results of {{marketing,}} very likely {{fort}}
This model could probably be adapted to other parts of the world.
The government also looks at ways of strengthening its ability to market both cultural industries and educational services.
In addition, the committee recommends that the Government of Canada should seek cooperation in the interested provinces to support more {{internationalisation}} {{»}} in education, that is to say the mobility of students and university {{des}} exchanges between institutions and international research and development networks.
The committee therefore recommends that the government is serious about the programmes which will help researchers and Canadian universities and higher education institutions in Canada to maintain international trade that will be useful in Canada.
{{Par}} through the Council of Ministers of {{du}} Canada {{le}} the government has excellent relations with the provinces in the area of international activities linked to education.
The {{a}} was invited to participate in meetings on {{en}} cooperation in higher education, research and training, as well as the {{visant}} {{rondes}} aimed at strengthening cooperation with the European Union on education.
It was also represented at meetings on education within the framework of the Economic Cooperation Forum {{(APEC).}} {{(APEC).}}
At the same time, some provinces have also been represented individually to these {{assises.}}
The government intends to make use of this cooperation for the essential {{internationalisation}} of higher education.
As we have pointed out in our response to the recommendation {{le}} Canada is currently negotiating a cooperation programme for education and training with the European Union and another similar with the United States and Mexico.
In addition, we will probably be able to participate in two years in the {{des}} mobility programme in {{l'Asie-Pacifique.}}
The committee therefore recommends that the government reaffirms the role of the leader of the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Organisation that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade must play on the federal level of cultural, scientific and international policies.
It also recommends that the relevant programmes, at the moment in the {{soient}} should be {{au}} within a sector of cultural relations, scientific and international relations.
Finally, the committee recommends that the government should examine the programmes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the international programmes of other ministries and bodies in order to bring together the most relevant in foreign affairs.
It also recommends that Canadian diplomats provide incentives and the necessary resources to effectively promote culture, science and Canadian education abroad.
{{Le}} the {{convient}} should show the way for what is {{au}} at federal level, the policy on cultural, scientific and educational relations abroad.
In the first instance, the {{du}} {{du}} {{du}} Office of which the last government was eliminating the functions, has been strengthened, and will now come to the {{responsable}} {{responsable}} responsible for the {{globaux.}}
The relevant programmes in the {{seront}} will be {{afin}} in order to increase efficiency in a strategy of international cultural relations.
In the context of this strategy, the {{examinera}} will also examine incentives and tools which Canadian diplomats need to effectively promote culture, science, and Canadian education abroad.
The Committee recommends that the government will continue to support the promotion of Canadian studies abroad.
The government agrees with this.
It is partly thanks to the support of the Canadian studies at the moment of around 35 35 countries.
Most of these countries are represented in the 20 national and multinational associations in the world, which are more than 6 000 members.
The associations and their members contribute to a great deal to make known and understand Canada in their respective countries.
They affect their work by decision-makers and the current and future opinion of opinion.
They also contribute to research and dialogue in international and national areas which are priority for Canada.
The government intends to continue with this activity of great importance, to encourage education, research and publications on Canada by the teachers of foreign {{étrangères.}}
In addition to the International Council of {{canadiennes,}} {{canadiennes,}} we will focus on the Member States of the {{et}} and the priority countries in the developed world and in development where there are associations of {{canadiennes.}}
The Committee recognises the importance of programmes such as {{International}} International {{et}} and the Commission's translation programmes for the {{du}} {{du}} {{canadienne}} {{canadienne}}
We must make no effort to make full use of the potential of {{particulièrement}} particularly since it is a question of {{l'image}} Canada beyond its borders.
The government takes note of this recommendation on the exploitation of the potential of Radio Canada International International {{(RCI)}} and the Commission's translation programmes of the {{du}} {{du}}
The government agrees that {{le}} Canada and Canadian values abroad can play an important role in promoting peace and mutual understanding.
{{est}} is very well placed in order to {{à}} abroad the commitment of {{au}} to dialogue and compromise, to democracy, to the rights of the person and to economic and social justice, to the environment, to peace and respect for diversity.
In addition, {{et}} and other free media have an important role to play in ensuring that the truth, transparency, and justice {{grâce}} through the interaction of many sources of information.
{{7:}} {{Le}} the role and place of Canada
{{7.1}} {{Le}} the Committee recommends that {{vise}} policy is aimed at protecting the vital interests of Canada, the conservation of sovereignty and Canadian independence and maintaining the capacity of the country to play an active and independent role on the international stage {{les}}
We believe that such a policy requires an appropriate distribution of resources for the instruments of its implementation, whether it is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and its missions abroad, the other ministries active abroad or Parliament.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} agrees that {{doit}} policy must protect the vital interests of the country.
The {{est}} is firmly resolved to achieve its financial objectives and to apply the principles of sound management of public funds.
It {{l'ordre}} the order of priority and {{les}} resources according to financial constraints.
The {{est}} is also changing its ways of making {{comprend}} includes more sensible use of {{pour}} in order to improve the programmes in practice.
Other {{qui}} measures which will go along the same lines, will result in full examination of the programmes.
In view of the importance of the {{à}} powers at the moment the US Congress particularly in trade issues relating to the interests of Canada, effective and direct means must be found to raise the concerns of Canada to the members of Congress and {{Sénat.}}
We believe that the {{Canada-États-Unis}} {{Canada-États-Unis}} group offers the potential for this.
However, Parliament must review its selection process so that the future delegations are set up by parliamentarians chosen for their knowledge of the subjects on the agenda.
The group should also work closely with the permanent committees responsible and with the Foreign Minister.
The {{croit}} also believes that it is important to promote the interests of Canada in the US Congress.
Our {{à}} in Washington has created a special unit which is responsible for relations with Congress to ensure that the leaders of Congress are well aware of the positions of Canada on certain American legislation.
{{continuera}} will continue to meet these leaders regularly and other {{américains.}}
All Canada offices will have the task of making our views more on the members of the House of representatives and {{ainsi}} as well as legislators of states.
The annual meeting of the {{Canada-États-Unis}} interparliamentary group is encouraging the exchange of views on interesting issues of the two countries.
It would be beneficial to hold more frequent and well prepared meetings on sectors or {{définis.}}
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is prepared to maintain {{rapports}} reports with the parliamentary group to help prepare meetings and to provide analyses on the issues raised.
The Committee recommends the government to base its policies and priorities on the benefits of Canada.
Canada should {{dans}} in the regions, to establish bilateral partnerships according to the regional importance of a country, its political and cultural ties with Canada and its contributions to achieving our objectives.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} accepts the committee's approach and, in its programmes, it will define the order of priority in order to promote the achievement of the overall objectives of its foreign policy.
The bilateral relations and multilateral organisations will help to achieve these objectives, and {{leur}} them will give priority to their degree of {{d'utilité.}}
The Committee confirms the commitment of Canada to a international system based on rules and extending the application of international law.
It also confirms the importance of better handling the multilateral institutions, making them more effective, and increase their democratic {{démocratique.}}
The committee therefore recommends the adoption of a strategy of {{dirigé}} {{»,}} that is to say a strategy that gives priority to the institutions that serve the best interests of {{canadiens.}} interests.
This should be combined with the establishment of bilateral relations with the countries of the same opinion that are best placed to advance the common {{communes.}}
In addition to the {{et}} and {{Francophonie,}} the targets of this strategy should include the United Nations and its {{spécialisées,}} agencies, the World Trade Organisation {{les}} international financial institutions and the {{des}} {{(G-7).}}
Canada must actively promote the next WTO {{prochaine}}
It must also promote an urgent reform of the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions.
The appropriate permanent committees of Parliament should reassess the accession of Canada to the various multilateral institutions, in order to present recommendations on the future of Canada.
{{Le}} {{Gouvernement}} agrees with the {{Comité.}}
It wishes to establish an international system based on rules, the enlarged application of international law, and on more effective multilateral institutions, better and more effective multilateral institutions.
The {{continuera}} will continue to act in this direction.
At the same time, {{reconnaît}} recognises that participation in the work of multilateral institutions is not an end in itself, but rather a means of achieving an end.
It will give priority to the institutions that will best promote the achievement of its objectives.
promoting prosperity and {{protéger}} protect our security in a {{et}} global framework and project values and culture.
In multilateral institutions, Canada will not be limited to public-private partnerships.
It will also seek to conclude alliances with neighbouring countries, its interests and objectives, which depend on the question of {{étudiée.}}
As the {{la}} {{Comité,}} the reform of the United Nations system, particularly that of bodies responsible for protecting peace and security, is an important objective of Canada.
It also takes the view that the WTO will be looking at the outstanding issues {{ex.,}} {{les}} subsidies for agricultural exports and the laws on the use of {{et}} and the new cases of competition, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the {{travail).}}
The Bretton Woods institutions and regional development banks play a key role in global development.
The {{va}} will therefore call for reform during the next economic summit to be held in {{Halifax.}}
The {{se}} welcomes the fact that the permanent committees responsible for the accession of Canada to various multilateral institutions.
{{8:}} {{La}} democratisation of policy
{{Une}} one of the proposals made in this context is to create a {{Centre}} Centre of foreign policy {{qui}} which {{les}} the priority areas of analysis and would contribute to public debate.
The {{est}} is of the opinion that there should be a better dialogue between the {{et}} and the {{au}} on foreign and relations policy that the country has with abroad.
He has held and will continue to keep its commitment to this Parliament to discuss the major foreign policy issues.
The first National Forum on international relations in Canada, which took place last March, was an important step in this direction.
This forum will be included every year, and soon in spring in {{sur}} on the general theme of the reform of international institutions.
The {{élargira}} {{et}} and {{ce}} process in {{des}} existing consultations with the community of NGOs in the field of human rights and with the private sector within the Advisory Committee on External Trade {{et}} and {{de}} of sectoral consultations on external trade {{et}} and {{de}}
These additional consultations {{d'autres}} other groups and individuals interested in the international dimensions of economic relations, development, and political affairs.
The {{estime}} also believes that dialogue must continue throughout the whole of the country.
That is why it decided to create a new consultation and information mechanism on foreign policy in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In order to consult the public and stimulate research into foreign policy, putting the speakers in place in this context, the Members of the experts and Members of the European Parliament and the people of the European Parliament are calling for it.
And to ensure that the {{et}} and {{sur}} are systematically consulted on all aspects of its foreign policy.

The first national forum on international relations in Canada was held in the context of the radical changes that were {{au}} within the international community.
During the two days of {{les}} the delegates took part in intensive workshops and a plenary assembly with the Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Ministers of the National Defence and Trade Ministers.
The participants had a mandate to identify the main economic, technological and scientific factors, social, cultural, cultural and military factors that have a direct impact on life and policies.

The participants have {{de}} many major challenges in their examination of the principles and priorities of the international relations of Canada.
This report is based on the diversity of the views expressed during the Forum and the general orientation of the discussions.
While strongly supporting the major principles behind the foreign policy of Canada, the participants in the Forum stressed the need to make choices among the priorities.
According to them, fundamental changes in international {{internationale,}} the close link between foreign and national policies, the current economic situation in Canada and the need to {{nos}} our international relations.
All of this requires the {{et}} and their government, to be {{en}} by taking the difficult but necessary decisions which will make Canada more effective on the international stage.
The participants reached the guiding principles of Canada and the defence of Canada - the new realities of sovereignty in the age of globalisation, the importance of active participation and the need to draw the best possible advantage of {{canadiennes.}} resources.
{{La}} the new sovereignty will make it possible and {{institutionnelle.}}
The participants in the Forum have noted an {{frappante.}} {{frappante.}}
The end of the Cold War allows the {{canadien,}} Government to take more free decisions on the other hand, but it is more limited by the international institutions and the transnational movement of capital, investment, finance and trade.
Despite a certain loss of {{les}} governments are forced to extend all the aspects of their international programme, trade, financial investment, sustainable development, the rights of the person and the defence of the Union.
The Canadian Government is also committed to its own {{contraintes.}}
The importance of national debt is undermining its ability to take a foreign and national activity, while the country is facing a real and increasing problem of unemployment and {{sous-emploi.}}
The participants in the Forum are convinced that the success of intervention in the international community depends on the ability of the government to make better use of its resources and to relaunch the national economy.
The participants also pointed out that foreign policy is no longer the {{des}} of governments, it is also the responsibility of the various speakers on the international stage.
This increased participation is due to the progress of information technology and the {{qui}} which are no longer {{par}} by the borders of {{géopolitiques.}}
The associations of business and professionals, the indigenous peoples and non-governmental organisations, among other things, participate in international relations in Canada.
The complex network of transnational relations between {{et}} and members of other companies extends the scope of our international relations.
The participants in the Forum have noted another {{paradoxe.}}
Although the scope of international relations is more extensive than ever, the government has not {{le}} and is unable to manage these new networks.
The government has the hands of financial constraints and by institutional {{institutionnelle.}}
Therefore, it is often perceived as {{et}} and ineffective.
The participants have stressed the importance of recognising these constraints without undermining the {{portée.}}
{{possèdent}} have a multitude of resources, enabling them to intervene at international and {{transnational.}} level.
They are the search for a renewal of foreign policy.
The members of the Forum called on the government to channel national resources and those of non-governmental organisations, and to consolidate our human {{humain,}} scientific and social activity and our financial resources, political and military resources, in order to improve the effectiveness of international {{Canada.}} relations.
{{Une}} a dynamic presence in the new international community.
The participants in the Forum insisted on the fact that Canada could perhaps take full advantage of active participation in the international arena.
The traditional distinction between national policy and foreign policy loses its importance in the light of the {{de}} influence of the international system on our daily lives.
The economic prosperity of Canada, its cultural nature {{la}} the viability of the environment and the military security of the country depend more than ever on the capacity of Canada to integrate the international community.
The participants pointed out that the security of the country is no longer threatened by the same {{».}} {{».}}
In fact, Canada and its allies will no longer be the target of direct attacks.
The main dangers to the security of Canada come from forces that threaten the security of the world.
The demographic increase in the environment, environmental degradation and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic and regional wars and the instability of the former Soviet {{soviétique.}}
It is better to prevent the {{est}} of the {{est}} is an old saying that it would be wise to apply the international relations of Canada.
The new international challenges require new policies, new instruments and {{des}} resources.
{{L'avantage}} the advantage of and the need to make choices.
The participants in the Forum recognised that, despite the increase in international relations, the government is neither {{ni}} nor {{omnipotent.}}
It is not {{l'être.}}
No one can expect the government to continue to do more with less and less resources.
The government must learn best and coordinate the resources of society in order to achieve national objectives.
It must also determine the areas of {{relatif}} where interests, skills and expertise and clearly establish its priorities.
The priorities of the Forum in the Forum have {{plusieurs}} several major priorities of the foreign and defence policies of Canada, but have been more difficult to find the priority to them.
{{La}} security.
The foreign policy of Canada, has explained one of the participants in the {{est}} is a gradual adjustment of national objectives and interests on the basis of international security.
It amounts to the management of our common future.
Safety includes the rights of the individual, economic prosperity, the viability of the environment and sound public management.
The participants in the Forum pointed out that the foreign policy of Canada must promote the security of the population and support a network of institutions and programmes that ensure free and constructive participation in society.
{{Les}} trade and economic relations
International economic relations are essential to the creation of jobs and the prosperity of the {{elles}} they must remain one of the main priorities of our foreign policy.
The welfare of Canadian citizens continues to be a large part of international trade and direct access to technology and foreign investment.
International trade has become highly {{il}} it means reciprocity of investments and associations, the {{d'exercer,}} of the joint development of technology and access to distribution networks.
{{et}} and services based on knowledge play an increasingly important role in international trade and competition.
Research research is of particular importance for Europe, since the end of the Cold War, and for the dynamic region of Asia and the Pacific region.
Our success in this more competitive and more complex global economy will be based on our economic development, our fiscal policies and regulations and the adoption of trade policies that will enable us to maintain our position in the markets established and to find new opportunities for the major markets in the future.
The participants in the Forum have strongly recommended the government to take the necessary measures to take full advantage of the new opportunities created by {{et}} and to ensure that our access to markets is not compromised by unfair and unilateral commercial practices from our partners.
The participants also pointed out that the government must take account of the social costs of the liberalisation of international trade and facilitate adaptation and the development of disadvantaged workers.
The rights of the person are {{droits}}
The participants discussed the link between trade and the rights of {{deux}} two fundamental priorities of foreign policy.
They have recognised that trade facilitates contact for large sectors of the authorities to defend themselves against {{et}} governments and offers Canada the opportunity to express its full commitment to the fundamental rights of the individual.
Trade and the rights of the person are not {{toutefois,}} however, Canada must reiterate its accession to the principles of the rights of the person as an element of a more complex network of relations.
Development aid for development
The participants in the Forum have agreed to include aid to the most disadvantaged countries in the priorities of policy policy.
The main form of aid to these countries is to open the Canadian markets to their exports and to encourage mutual trade relations with them.
Having said that, the participants have insisted that the promotion of trade should be a separate activity of aid programmes.
{{canadienne}} policy on aid should therefore focus on the sustainability of the environment, humanitarian aid and the development of social, human and financial resources, especially among women.
The participants have once again highlighted the importance of close cooperation with non-governmental organisations and {{d'affaires.}}
The maintenance of peace.
Despite the new light of the international community, the maintenance of peace remains a fundamental priority and a {{relatif}} area for Canada.
The {{pour}} approach to maintaining peace must go beyond the military dimension and include speakers in many sectors through cooperation with non-governmental organisations, which play a key role in maintaining peace.
The members of the Forum have called on Canada to play a leading role in the design of better infrastructure of peace and to export its advantage on logistics by {{en}} training and experience.
Canada must also establish guidelines and priorities so that its participation in the maintenance of peace is in value and strengthens its interests and other commitments in principle.
{{Les}} the United Nations.
According to the participants in the {{les}} the United Nations is an important asset for Canada, the {{qui}} which must be used and protected.
However, they recognised that the United Nations and its agencies do not work in a uniform way.
While some of them are doing an excellent job, others are {{et}} and they need changes.
The members of the Forum strongly recommended in the 50th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations - which will be celebrated in 1995 - that Canada is conducting an international reform of the United Nations, its administration and its {{spécialisées,}} agencies, and that it is working mainly with those who are effective and responsible.
{{défense.}} defence.
Defence policy has not been examined as detailed as other parts of the international relations of Canada.
A large part of those who have examined defence have highlighted the unique opportunity at the moment in Canada to restructure its forces in order to meet the challenges of a new international community in which Canada and its traditional allies are no longer directly affected.
They have insisted that the policy of defence of Canada can see the territorial security of Canada, ensuring the protection of our airspace and coastal waters and provides aid to the authority authority.
This is why it will have to encourage the increased specialisation of its forces and roles to increase our contribution to global security and complement our foreign policy.
This point of view is {{avec}} with the efforts that are currently being made to benefit and greater efficiency, despite limited resources.
{{L'OTAN.}} {{L'OTAN.}}
The assessment of the current usefulness of NATO since the end of the Cold War was a source of division among the participants in the {{Forum.}}
For many of them, NATO has no reason to be now that Europe has the means to ensure its own security.
On the other hand, however, we have recognised that with NATO Canada could respect its commitment to combat any military conflict in Europe.
However, a consensus can be reached on the effect that Canada has advantage to remain a member of NATO, but it should encourage this body to redefine its military {{militaire.}}
Some participants have insisted that Canada should look at its financial obligations, focusing on its specialised skills and provides its expertise in NATO.
{{et}} and strategic associations the participants in the Forum have made no contradiction between Canadian multilateral commitments and the many strategic associations so important for Canada.
They have extended the concept of strategic association to include not only foreign partners but also those by which they can work together with the government to improve the international relations of Canada.
{{Les}} the United States.
Members of the Forum highlighted the importance of giving particular attention to our special relations with the United States, our most important trading partner and the only superpower in the world.
They expressed their concern at the fact that Canada is increasingly dependent on the United States on the economy and trade.
Many participants provide for an increase in {{à}} as the United States will be tempted to act unilaterally to protect their interests in the international trade system where they are no longer the {{incontestés.}} {{incontestés.}}
{{Les}} {{stratégiques.}}
The participants in the Forum have demonstrated the urgency of focusing more on the regions in the {{croissance}}
China, the other countries with the Pacific {{Pacifique,}} Europe, Mexico and future partners in {{dans}} can be important and effective partners, which will also balance our relations with the United States.
{{Les}} multilateral institutions.
The participants in the Forum unanimously recognised that the strengthening of the rules on rules and multilateral institutions is the central objective of the foreign security and trade policies in Canada.
The rules for rules play a fundamental role when it comes to making progress or serve the interests of {{et}} and even when they contribute to global security.
The multilateral system, based on rules, gives Canada a prestige and openness beyond what is called its size and its economy.
Canada should set itself as a priority for the creation or reorganisation of multilateral institutions, especially the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations, both very important for Canada.
However, members of the Forum have pointed out to be a member of multilateral institutions not an end in itself.
As a member of an institution, it is commercial or whether it is a security body, Canada must establish specialised policies that will {{son}} its {{relatif.}}
{{Des}} choices.
Private companies and non-governmental organisations are currently deciding where they will focus their efforts to increase their efforts as much as possible.
The participants in the Forum recommended government participation in multilateral bodies that are more strategic and better defined.
In this way, the government will thus avoid extending its own resources and losing its effectiveness.
Many participants have said that Canada does not show all the necessary discrimination in its accession choices that it is not necessarily interested in the institutions that share its interests and that this practice is also detrimental to the ability of Canada to devote the resources necessary to support a wide range of projects.
The members of the Forum strongly recommended the government to assess the effectiveness of multilateral institutions.
They have suggested that Canada commits its resources mainly in the institutions whose efficiency and objectives are {{avec}} with those of the new international community.
Canada should also consider the reallocation of certain resources to new gender {{d'organisations,}} such as the {{inuit}} {{et}} Conference and the project of a Arctic Council, which can meet the new challenges that they are {{qu'ils}} political, environmental or security.
{{Les}} organisations are {{gouvernementales.}}
The participants in the Forum recommended that private companies, business associations and professionals, non-governmental organisations, churches and universities play a key role in international relations in international relations.
The government should do its strategic {{stratégiques,}} by inviting the speakers of civil society to participate more closely in coordinating policies by facilitating their participation in the international market and by establishing their resources for the best possible {{possible.}}
{{politiques}} of {{La}}
In the opinion of the participants, the first National Forum has proved an interesting experience and an impressive step towards the democratisation of new policies.
This meeting of people from different sectors, which looked at the coordination of the objectives of policies and on the creation of links between the {{a}} has been most useful.
The participants recognised that sectoral discussions are not the same as coordination, networks and difficult choices.
However, Members have highlighted everything that remains to be done to ensure that the European foreign and defence policies are {{reliées}} linked to national priorities and {{enracinées}} in the values and {{canadiennes.}} society.
They have identified four priorities - coordination, {{l'éducation}} public education and the ability to carry out an informed analysis of policies.
{{La}} coordination.
The members of the Forum have recommended better integration of foreign and defence policies, so that Canada can increase its international relations.
They have called for the coordination of activities linked to trade and defence, with development aid, migration policies, environmental policies, the promotion of the rights of the person and participation in multilateral institutions.
The participants in the Forum have proposed that the government should implement processes that promote the movement and exchange of people and ideas between the various government ministries and other groups of society, so that they can better coordinate and understand policies.
The members of the Forum suggested that the government strongly encourages cooperation between the government, the business environment and non-governmental organisations.
Such cooperation is important for the creation of goods and services based on knowledge which will allow Canada to play an active role in the international community.
{{La}} and education.
The parties in the Forum welcomed the intention of the government to encourage Parliament to participate more actively in the development of more responsible and transparent foreign and defence policies.
Parliament or its committees should be able to count on permanent research staff and experts in the analysis of policies in order to be able to carry out a further review of policies and contribute to specialised public debates on international relations of Canada.
{{L'analyse}} analysis of the policies.
The participants have highlighted the need to encourage and coordinate an excellent analysis of international relations in Canada.
Canada is the only OECD country that cannot count on a national institute to coordinate the current foreign and defence policies, to identify the priorities of such an analysis and to participate in the public debate.
The parties in the Forum have urged the government to provide for a permanent national forum or a centre of {{de}} {{conjointement}} jointly by the private and public sectors, which could be responsible for coordinating the resources allocated to research and analysis in order to avoid duplication of the resources allocated to research and analysis in order to avoid any duplication and to ensure the best possible yield for the coordination of various issues.
The participants in the National Forum on International Relations in Canada welcomed this first effort of opening up the debate on new ideas and the study of new ideas in this important period of international relations in Canada.
The members of the Forum recognise the urgency of {{le}} the process of the formulation of policies and to welcome new ideas and participants while the Canada Government is preparing to increase its strategic associations with society and that the international stage is increasingly preparing for those who have the best knowledge, skills and experience.
We want to thank the Foreign Ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for their {{leur}} support and participation.
On behalf of all the members of the {{nous}} we are {{ce}} this report.
