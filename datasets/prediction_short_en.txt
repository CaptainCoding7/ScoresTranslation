{{1:}} {{REPENSER}} {{LES}} {{PRIORITÉS}} {{PRIORITÉS}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{LA}} {{ÉTRANGÈRE}} {{La}} and foreign policy is not {{elle}}
It requires continued political will and mobilisation of national resources to deal with international challenges.
Even the most powerful nations must deal with the {{cela}} forces, even more for Canada.
{{des}} the internal forces also affect foreign policy.
The effective mobilisation of national resources of a country depends on its human and physical characteristics, but also of this will that comes from the balanced combination of national objectives and international responsibilities.
In the case of Canada, the potential is there, as is the desire for {{de}} to see their country play an important role in the world.
We hope that this report will help to achieve this {{désir.}}
Any examination of foreign policy must take account of the international and internal changes that have been made.
The review of the {{fut}} was carried out in the Cold War, at a time when a light of {{et}} and the issues of unity and independence {{les}} the {{Canadiens.}}
At the last review in {{les}} the {{dominants}} issues were security and international competition, independence and {{l'internationalisme.}}
Only ten years later, the situation is still different at all.
We are living in a new era of {{comme}} changes such as witnesses to us in the {{audiences.}}
The end of the Cold War is certainly the most profound of these changes, but other {{transforment}} forces turn the nature of security, {{les}} economies and societies and make the concept of national sovereignty.
The global context in developing the Cold War has {{les}} the security cards not only in Europe but throughout the world.
In Europe, we are still waiting for the introduction of the new order which will replace the one from the {{Yalta.}} Conference.
The end of the Cold War has led to the freedom and the possibility of creating better societies, but it has also left a legacy of instability and {{division.}}
{{quant}} about the democratisation of Eastern Europe and Russia, as Professor Jacques {{de}} of the University of {{à}} in Montreal has told us.
{{Instabilité}} {{due}} due to {{après}} after the total {{total}} of the Communist period, old nationalist {{nationalistes}} and ethnic tensions in the former Soviet Union.
There is a division not only in the countries of the East, after the disintegration of the Communist regime, but also in the West where the end of the ideological fight between East and West has {{comme}} as Professor {{Stairs}} {{de}} of the University of {{(18:21),}} {{le}} the need for transatlantic solidarity.
In Asia, the end of the Cold War has also had {{inattendues.}} consequences.
It has put an end to the fight against {{et}} and the {{sino-soviétique.}} {{sino-soviétique.}} except from North Korea, it also encouraged greater openness to the West.
However, {{conflits}} conflicts {{la}} the proliferation of weapons, the risks of civil {{civils,}} and the prospect of {{durable»}} development is likely to complicate the search for a new regional balance, as Professor Brian {{de}} said in the University of {{Colombie-Britannique.}}
In the rest of the world, the old reference points have {{:}}
{{ne}} relations no longer determine {{et}} relations, and for some countries, international aid has lost its geopolitical dimension.
The north and the South are also in terms of {{la}} the very concept of the Third World is becoming {{puisque}} since the southern {{Sud}} has more and more diversity, and that the gap between rich and poor is as much as between North and South.
The new world does not provide for {{il}} it also presents opportunities to {{saisir.}}
The relatively stable confrontation between the East and the West has {{d'après}} according to Professor {{Middlemiss}} {{de}} of {{Dalhousie}} University {{à}} to a {{où}} where threats are very {{et}} and for which it is difficult to establish plans.
If we are in the past, which was {{nos}} our future opponents are {{ou}} or difficult to {{distinguer.}}
The problem is no longer to defend the West against the East, but to protect the community against the failure to comply with international order by those who still have the illegal use of force to impose their will.
That is the challenge facing us.
